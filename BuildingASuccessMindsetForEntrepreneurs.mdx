Have you ever wondered what sets apart successful entrepreneurs from the rest? It's not just luck or a fancy business degree. It's something deeper, a way of thinking and approaching challenges that fuels their drive and propels them forward. It's the **entrepreneur mindset**.

This mindset is a powerful tool that can help you overcome obstacles, embrace failure, and achieve your goals. It's about believing in yourself, your vision, and your ability to make a difference. It's about being adaptable, resilient, and always learning.

## The Power of Positive Thinking

The first step in building a successful entrepreneurial mindset is to adopt a positive attitude. It's all about the power of positive thinking. If you believe you can achieve something, you're more likely to do it. When faced with a challenge, instead of thinking, "I can't do this," try reframing your thoughts to "What can I do to make this happen?" Instead of focusing on your weaknesses, focus on your strengths and what you can bring.

## Embrace Failure

One of the biggest fears for entrepreneurs is failure. But the truth is that failure is an inevitable part of the entrepreneurial journey. Every entrepreneur has failed at some point or another. It's how you react to failure that matters. Instead of dwelling on your failures, use them as learning experiences. Take the time to reflect on what went wrong, and use those lessons to improve and do things differently next time. As a famous entrepreneur once said, "I have not failed. I have just found 10,000 ways that won't work."

## Surround Yourself with Positive People

Your mindset is heavily influenced by the people you surround yourself with. Surrounding yourself with negative people who constantly bring you down will not help you build a successful entrepreneurial mindset. Instead, surround yourself with positive, like-minded individuals who inspire you to improve. Join entrepreneurial groups, and attend networking events to meet other entrepreneurs on a similar journey.

## Stay Motivated with Goal-Setting

Setting goals is an amazing way to stay motivated and focused on what you want to achieve. Start by setting long-term goals - where do you want to be in 5, 10, or even 20 years? Break those long-term goals down into smaller, achievable milestones, and set deadlines for when you want to achieve them. Don't forget to celebrate your achievements along the way. This will help keep you motivated and focused on your end goals.

## Take Action and Be Resilient

One of the key differences between successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs is taking action. Successful entrepreneurs don't wait for opportunities to come - they create them. But taking action isn't always easy. It requires a lot of hard work and resilience. You're going to face obstacles, setbacks, and failures along the way. But it's very important to keep pushing forward and not give up in the face of adversity.

## Embrace Risk with a Calculated Approach

Entrepreneurship is inherently risky. You're building something from scratch, and there's no guarantee it will work out. But successful entrepreneurs don't shy away from risk - they embrace it with a calculated approach. Before taking any risks, it's important to research and weigh the pros and cons. Identify potential risks, and plan for how you're going to mitigate them. This will surely help you make more informed decisions and increase your chances of success.

## Adopt a Growth Mindset

To build a successful entrepreneurial mindset, you need to adopt a growth mindset. This means believing that you can grow and improve rather than thinking that your abilities are set in stone. With a growth mindset, you're more likely to take risks, embrace failure, and be resilient in the face of challenges. You'll also be more open to feedback and continuously learning and improving yourself and your business.

## The Importance of Self-Care

Entrepreneurship can be incredibly demanding, both physically and mentally. It's important to take care of yourself if you want to build a successful business. This means getting good enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Don't ever forget to take time for yourself and do things you enjoy. Burnout is a real risk for entrepreneurs; regular breaks can help prevent it.

## Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

Imposter syndrome is a common feeling among entrepreneurs. It's the feeling that you don't deserve success and will be exposed as a fraud. But the truth is that most successful entrepreneurs have felt this way at some point in their journey. One way to overcome imposter syndrome is to focus on your achievements and the value you bring to your business. Take the time to acknowledge your successes and the efforts you've put in to get there. It's very helpful to remember that everyone has unique strengths and weaknesses. Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on building your skills and knowledge.

## Building a Support System

As an entrepreneur, you're going to face challenges and setbacks. Having a support system can make a huge difference in your ability to overcome those challenges. Whether it's a mentor, a coach, or a group of like-minded entrepreneurs, having people to turn to for advice and support can be incredibly helpful. Don't be scared to reach out to others and ask for help when needed.

## Create Your Own Luck

So-called lucky people aren't necessarily getting more advantages than other people. The universe doesn't favor them, but they're putting themselves out there more. They're creating more connections that could lead to other stuff. That is really how I interpret luck - creating more of a mathematical probability that you're going to get what you want. Luck's a funny thing. It is about creating a mathematical probability by putting ourselves out there and trying more things. When you start a business, it might fail - don't worry about it - that's how to have a business mindset. You might have to create ten businesses before one will be successful. We make our luck with the decisions we make and the actions we take.

## Give. Give. Give.

Helping and sharing is content marketing, which is how you build a business nowadays. Build an audience, then determine what they need from you. Create content, find your audience, and build your business. Please do not fall into the trap of building a product or service and then trying to find customers - that is a recipe for disaster.

## The Growth Mindset

The growth mindset should be an obvious business mindset, and it is essential to your succeeding as an entrepreneur. You need to have the mentality that you can teach yourself to do anything if you push yourself hard enough and try enough things. This idea has been further explored and validated by a famous entrepreneur in her classic book titled Mindset. The New Psychology of Success.

## The Path of Unpredictability

It was easy to see how I could be making more money working for bigger, more established institutions, so I drew two lines to compare. I drew a line of stability and predictability at a high level of income, where I would be if I had stayed in the path I was in. I then drew a second, lower line that would be what I could expect as an entrepreneur: bootstrapping a company, not paying myself a salary for a few years trying to make ends meet, and with more uncertainty in the long term. Most of us would not do this, but it might be the business mindset you need to succeed. There is no right or wrong approach - follow the method that feels right to you. We have to figure out for ourselves what will shift our mindset to leap. Become comfortable being uncomfortable. To accomplish this, it takes emotional intelligence.

## Create a Mission Worth Spending Your Life On

I have confidence about myself as a human being. Just appreciate that wherever you're at, you're a whole and complete human being with everything you possibly need to be successful. You deserve to achieve and you deserve the fruits of your labor. There is no such thing as a born entrepreneur. We all have it in us to step up and achieve things as long as we are willing to do so. We must be aware that our every success and position in life spring forth from our actions and efforts. We deserve the fruit of our labor and to do big, cool things.

## Your Business Will Never Be Worse Than It Is Today

From the moment we launch something, whether a product, an entrepreneur podcast, a blog, or a new service, we want it to be perfect. So perfect that it typically doesn't even get launched because it never meets our expectations. We often think something is a failure, even when just starting. Be willing to suck at the beginning. Be aware that you have to get better progressively. This is a brilliant business mindset geared for success. Feel comforted by the knowledge that whatever you do or publish today is the worst it will ever be, and you will continue to nurture and improve it.

## Don't Struggle with Failure

There is a difference between failure and your struggle with failure. You do not have to struggle with failure. That is a choice on your part. If you accept the fact that the person who fails the most wins, you can also accept that putting good effort into something that fails is a key part of your job. Failure is something that is inevitable in business and life, but somehow we seem better equipped to deal with it in day-to-day life. We start dealing with it the moment when we learn how to walk because falling is an essential part of the learning process. You have to fall repeatedly until you've learned how to walk. Giving up is not an option. We should bear in mind that business success works in the same way. Failing is part of the process of getting good at and mastering something. Making mistakes and dealing with failures is part of your job as an entrepreneur.

## Have an Incredible Vision for Your Business

You don't climb straight from nothing to something big. You hit an obstacle, climb over it and reach the next level of the plateau. You cross the line again, cross another obstacle and climb to the next level again. The more you do that, the more you will look back and realize how far you've come. It is all about overcoming each obstacle as it hits, and not giving up. There is no such thing as smooth sailing. Nevertheless, when you fall while climbing an obstacle, you simply land back on the plateau you were just on. You don't have to start from scratch again. Life generally works this way: everything seems to go well until something sideswipes you. The analogy of the plateaus is fitting for a successful business mindset because you always fall to the previous plateau. The only struggle is getting onto the next one. Once you achieve that, you are safe and only have to pound on the next obstacles.

## Do Something Bold

Failures in business are opportunities to be seized. If you don't fail at one point in your lifetime, you won't experience the ultimate feeling of success. True success comes from a pile of failures and learning from them. As a result, you'll be able to make the right choices. I'm not a perfect person. I have made mistakes - as an entrepreneur, as a small business owner, as a human being - and will probably make a ton more. As a result, I'll learn from them and become even more successful. You need to build the same success mindset. When something doesn't work, change it to see what works. The classic definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly, expecting a different result. As human beings and business owners, we get stuck in our ruts. We do the same things over and over without thinking until something happens. It is necessary to do bold things, not just when going out of business. Test everything and contemplate what your business could be. Even if your business is doing okay, you could do something bold. In the worst-case scenario, you go back to doing exactly what you were doing before, so it is always worth a shot.

## You Don't Need Permission to Be an Entrepreneur

When a baby is learning to walk, they constantly fall over, but that doesn't make them want to stop trying. They don't think, That's it, I'm done with walking. I look stupid, everybody is laughing at me. I will just crawl from now on.' As human beings, we are not naturally afraid of looking stupid or failing  we get educated into it. This is the best business hack I have heard about being comfortable while being wrong. When babies do not yet know how to walk, they won't stop trying after falling down a few times. We are not born afraid of failure but are taught to be embarrassed by it. Bearing that in mind will hopefully help you leap into the unknown.

## Be Passionate About Your Business (Not Your Market)

I think a lot of entrepreneurs limit themselves to the markets they are passionate about. Personally, I'm passionate about business. When we went into the survival and preparedness market, I wasn't that passionate about it. I don't even like camping, but I know that other people do. I don't think you can remove passion from the process  someone will always be passionate. It just doesn't have to be you, so I see myself as a publisher, a producer, an owner. Ryan's business hack is not just for entrepreneurs. Many entrepreneurs  and people looking to start a side hustle or become a freelancer- think they need to go into a market they are passionate about. But either their passion doesn't align with the market hunger for a product, or it just limits them in some way. Ryan's passion is business, so he can enter any market and do well. He has a business mindset. This is how I see it: if I enter a market that is easy to make money in and build a solid business, I can use it to buy time and freedom and follow my passions. This is the ultimate online business model. As Ryan says, he considers himself a producer and a business owner rather than a person who is passionate about a specific market.

## Write Down Your Fears (Not Your Goals)

People always tell you to write down your goals, but I write down my fears. Writing down your fears makes them look less scary. When you dimensionalize your own fears and risks, it's amazing how much courage you will realize you have. Goals setting can be very limiting: once you reach a goal, you have nothing left to do. Your fears, on the other hand, are at the basis of an intrinsic problem: why are you not taking action on your online business ideas, starting a business or going towards your goals? The answer is that you are usually scared because there are many aspects you don't know the first thing about. The reason we don't do things is not that we didn't set the right goals, it's that we are afraid. I have a piece of paper, a "fears page, if you will, on which I write down whatever keeps me from doing something at a specific moment. By doing so, I can dimensionalize my fears, as Jay said. This has enabled me to see my mistakes and how limiting fears can be. Don't write down your goals. Write down your fears.

## Most Things in Life Fail (And That's Okay)

We have no ability to predict our future, so it is important to have themes. Jon's theme was to go to a mastermind in order to inspire and be inspired by smart people, which provided him with a variety of ways for self-improvement. That is a theme rather than a specific goal. His theme led to him starting a podcast, which I'm sure he enjoys, or he wouldn't have done so many episodes. Themes rather than goals. Indeed, we don't know where the future will lead us. I knew I wanted to create an online business, and my podcast ended up being that business. James Altucher is right: I had no idea I would create it. I am quite sure that if I'd known what was coming, I would have got bored and lost my passion. As a result, I would have been unsuccessful. We should be open because we can't predict the future. However, having themes around what you want to do is good. Themes are the best way to set yourself up for success as you see it.

## Be a Painkiller (Not a Vitamin)

Every company needs to solve a problem, which you can compare to the function of a painkiller as opposed to a vitamin. When we have a toothache, we want a painkiller, not a vitamin, and we're willing to pay for it. Does a business mindset get any simpler than this? If your business solves a problem your customer is experiencing, you are their painkiller. The customer will immediately need your assistance. Even though the vitamin market is massive, it's a much tougher thing to sell because vitamins are easily forgotten. I love the simplicity of Matt's approach: Be a painkiller, not a vitamin." If you offer a service that people need, they will happily pay for it.

## If Your Business Fails, It's Because You Suck

There's no middle ground. Something either worked because it worked out, or it failed because I wasn't good enough. That's okay. I have to be okay with the possibility that everything could fall apart, even if I do everything I can to make this company happen. If it fails, it's probably because I suck. Saying that something failed because we suck sounds harsh, but it is absolute ownership. We must take ownership of not just the companies we build but our entire lives. Even though many situations are out of our control, we can't just sit there worrying about what could happen. Moreover, we can't blame others when something happens to us. We are responsible. When we decide to put ourselves out there by creating a product, service or startup, we must be aware that everything comes down to us. We are putting ourselves on the line. By doing that, we allow ourselves to succeed, just like Austen did.

## Avoid the Entrepreneurial Gap

The gap is what's between today's goal and the horizon. If you look back at your achievements and consider how far you've come, you will stay out of the gap. However, if you're always walking towards the horizon, without turning around and recognizing your goals as you achieve them, you will never feel fulfilled. The entrepreneurial gap has caused a huge business mindset shift for me. It is crazy that we as entrepreneurs, are always searching for that horizon. We set goals three months, six months, a year, five years in advance. However, we instantly set five or ten loftier goals when we hit those goals. Congratulate yourself on your successes and improvements as you go. It's an amazing accomplishment to work towards something to better yourself and your family, and you should spend more time contemplating how far you have come. It is tempting to think that you always feel the need to first accomplish a certain thing, achieve a certain result, or let your business hit a million dollars. There will always be something new, so take the time to feel proud of what you have already achieved.

## Know Enough to Be Dangerous

As entrepreneurs we need to know enough to be dangerous in every area. If someone crosses our path and isn't good at their job, we have to be able to recognize that. That's part of what creates these long days: we need to learn all aspects of the business. If we don't, it is hard to delegate, because we don't know what is good and what is bad. One of my favourite business hacks: Knowing enough to be dangerous gives us the leverage points we need. It is very hard to outsource something completely if you know nothing about it. We don't need to know everything and be accountants, lawyers and editors all in one, but we must know enough to be dangerous. Don't listen to the experts who tell you you can only do a bit of your business and have to outsource the rest. There's no such thing as a four-hour work week and being able to outsource everything, especially not at the beginning. Unfortunately, you have to dive in head first and learn everything about your business that there is to learn. This works if you want to learn how to get on the first page of Google or sell courses online. Then, when you get lucky and have that momentum, you can take the revenue you've created, take all the bits of knowledge you have and put people in place to take care of those things. Remember, it's still your business, and you are still responsible for it.
