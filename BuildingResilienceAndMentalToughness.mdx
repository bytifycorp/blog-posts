Life is full of ups and downs. We all experience setbacks, failures, and challenges. But how we respond to these difficulties can make all the difference. Some people bounce back quickly, while others get bogged down by anxiety, depression, and fear of the future. The key to navigating these challenges and thriving in the face of adversity is building resilience and mental toughness.

## What is Resilience and Mental Toughness?

Resilience is the ability to adapt well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or significant sources of stress. It's about bouncing back from difficult experiences and continuing to move forward. Mental toughness is a related concept that refers to the ability to stay strong in the face of adversity, to keep your focus and determination despite the difficulties you encounter. Mentally tough individuals see challenge and adversity as an opportunity and not a threat, and have the confidence and positive approach to take what comes in their stride.

## The 4 C's of Mental Toughness

Mental toughness is built upon four key components:

* **Control:** This is the extent to which you feel you are in control of your life, including your emotions and sense of life purpose. To be high on the Control scale means to feel comfortable in your own skin and have a good sense of who you are. You're able to control your emotions and be less distracted by the emotions of others.
* **Commitment:** This is the extent of your personal focus and reliability. To be high on the Commitment scale is to be able to effectively set goals and consistently achieve them, without getting distracted. A high Commitment level indicates that you're good at establishing routines and habits that cultivate success.
* **Challenge:** This is the extent to which you are driven and adaptable. To be high on the Challenge scale means that you are driven to achieve your personal best, and you see challenges, change, and adversity as opportunities rather than threats. You are likely to be flexible and agile.
* **Confidence:** This is the extent to which you believe in your ability to be productive and capable; it is your self-belief and the belief that you can influence others. To be high on the Confidence scale is to believe that you will successfully complete tasks, and to take setbacks in stride while maintaining routine and even strengthening your resolve.

## Building Resilience and Mental Toughness: Strategies and Activities

There are many strategies and activities that can help you build resilience and mental toughness. Here are some of the most effective:

### 1. Skill Acquisition

Acquiring new skills can play an important part in building resilience, as it helps to develop a sense of mastery and competency. Skills to be learned will depend on the individual. For example, some might benefit from improving cognitive skills such as working memory or selective attention, which will help with everyday functioning. Others might benefit from learning new hobbies or activities through competency-based learning. Acquiring new skills within a group setting gives the added benefit of social support, which also cultivates resilience.

### 2. Goal Setting

The ability to develop goals, actionable steps to achieve those goals, and to execute, all help to develop will-power and mental resilience. Goals can be large or small, related to physical health, emotional wellbeing, career, finance, spirituality, or just about anything. Goals that involve skill-acquisition will have a double benefit. For example, learning to play an instrument or learning a new language. Some research indicates that setting and working towards goals beyond the individual, i.e. religious involvement or volunteering for a cause, can be especially useful in building resiliency. This may provide a deeper sense of purpose and connection, which can be valuable during challenging times.

### 3. Controlled Exposure

Controlled exposure refers to the gradual exposure to anxiety-provoking situations, and is used to help individuals overcome their fears. Research indicates that this can foster resilience, and especially so when it involves skill-acquisition and goal setting. Public speaking, for example, is a useful life skill but also something that evokes fear in many people. People who are afraid of public speaking can set goals involving controlled exposure, in order to develop or acquire this particular skill. They can expose themselves to a small audience of one or two people, and progressively increase their audience size over time. This type of action plan can be initiated by the individual, or it can be developed with a therapist trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Successful efforts can increase self-esteem and a sense of autonomy and mastery, all of which can be utilized in times of adversity.

### 4. Make Connections

Resilience can be strengthened through our connection to family, friends, and community. Healthy relationships with people who care about you and will listen to your problems, offer support during difficult times and can help us to reclaim hope. Likewise, assisting others in their time of need can benefit us greatly and foster our own sense of resilience.

### 5. Avoid seeing crises as insurmountable problems.

We cannot change the external events happening around us, but we can control our reaction to these events. In life, there will always be challenges, but it's important to look beyond whatever stressful situation you are faced with, and remember that circumstances will change. Take notice of the subtle ways in which you may already start feeling better as you deal with the difficult situation.

### 6. Accept that change is a part of living.

They say that the only thing constant in life is change. As a result of difficult circumstances, certain goals may no longer be realistic or attainable. By accepting that which you cannot change, it allows you to focus on the things that you do have control over.

### 7. Move toward your goals.

Though it is important to develop long-term, big-picture goals, it is essential to make sure they're realistic. Creating small, actionable steps makes our goals achievable, and helps us to regularly work towards these goals, creating small wins along the way. Try to accomplish one small step towards your goal every day.

### 8. Take decisive actions.

Instead of shying away from problems and stresses, wishing they would just go away, try to take decisive action whenever possible.

### 9. Look for opportunities for self-discovery.

Sometimes tragedy can result in great learnings and personal growth. Living through a difficult situation can increase our self-confidence and sense of self-worth, strengthen our relationships, and teach us a great deal about ourselves. Many people who have experienced hardship have also reported a heightened appreciation for life and deepened spirituality.

### 10. Nurture a positive view of yourself.

Working to develop confidence in yourself can be beneficial in preventing difficulties, as well as building resilience. Having a positive view of yourself is crucial when it comes to problem-solving and trusting your own instincts.

### 11. Keep things in perspective.

When times get tough, always remember that things could be worse; try to avoid blowing things out of proportion. In cultivating resilience it helps to keep a long-term perspective when facing difficult or painful events.

### 12. Maintain a hopeful outlook.

When we focus on what is negative about a situation and remain in a fearful state, we are less likely to find a solution. Try to maintain a hopeful, optimistic outlook, and expect a positive outcome instead of a negative one. Visualization can be a helpful technique in this respect.

### 13. Take care of yourself.

Self-care is an essential strategy for building resilience and helps to keep your mind and body healthy enough to deal with difficult situations as they arise. Taking care of yourself means paying attention to your own needs and feelings, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Regular physical exercise is also a great form of self-care.

### 14. Additional ways of strengthening resilience may be helpful.

Resilience building can look like different things to different people. Journaling, practicing gratitude, meditation, and other spiritual practices help some people to restore hope and strengthen their resolve.

`The American Psychological Association (APA) defines resilience as the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or significant sources of stress such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems or workplace and financial stressors. In other words, "bouncing back" from difficult experiences. Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have.`

## Factors in Resilience

Many factors contribute to resilience, but studies have shown that the primary factor is having supportive relationships within and outside of the family. Relationships that are caring, loving, and offer encouragement and reassurance, help cultivate a person's resilience. The APA suggests several additional factors that are associated with resilience, including:

* The capacity to make realistic plans and actionable steps to carry them out.
* A positive self-view and confidence in your strengths and abilities.
* Communication and problem-solving skills.
* The capacity to manage and regulate strong feelings and impulses.

## Building Resilience in Children and Adolescents

Just like adults, mentally strong children and adolescents are able to tackle problems, bounce back from failure, and cope with life's challenges and hardships. They are resilient and have the courage and confidence to reach their full potential. Developing mental strength in students is just as important, if not more important, as developing mental strength in adults. Here are some strategies to help students develop the strength they need to become a mentally strong adult:

* **Teach Specific Skills:** Rather than making kids suffer for their mistakes, discipline should be about teaching kids how to do better next time. Instead of punishment, use consequences that teach useful skills, such as problem-solving and impulse control.
* **Let Your Child Make Mistakes:** Mistakes are an inevitable part of life and learning. Teach your child or student that this is so and that they shouldn't be embarrassed or ashamed about getting something wrong.
* **Teach Your Child How to Develop Healthy Self-Talk:** It's important to help children develop a realistic and optimistic outlook on life, and how to reframe negative thoughts when they arise. Learning this skill early in life will help them persevere through difficult times.
* **Encourage Your Child to Face Fears Head-On:** Enabling a child to face their fears head-on will help them gain invaluable confidence. One way to do this is to teach your child to step outside of their comfort zone and face their fears one small step at a time while praising and rewarding their efforts.
* **Allow Your Child to Feel Uncomfortable:** It can be tempting to soothe or rescue your child or student whenever they are struggling, but it's important to allow them to sometimes lose or struggle, and insist that they are responsible even when they don't want to be. Dealing with small struggles on their own can help children to build their mental strength.
* **Build Character:** Children with a strong moral compass and value system will be better able to make healthy decisions. You can help by instilling values such as honesty and compassion, and creating learning opportunities that reinforce these values, regularly.
* **Make Gratitude a Priority:** Practicing gratitude is one of the greatest things you can do for your mental health, and it's no different for children. Gratitude helps us to keep things in perspective, even during the most challenging times. To raise a mentally strong child you should encourage them to practice gratitude on a regular basis.
* **Affirm Personal Responsibility:** Accepting responsibility for your actions or mistakes is also part of building mental strength involves. If your student is trying to blame others for the way he/she thinks, feels or behaves, simply steer them away from excuses and allow for explanations.
* **Teach Emotion Regulation Skills:** Instead of soothing or calming down your child every time they are upset, teach them how to deal with uncomfortable emotions on their own so that they don't grow up depending on you to regulate their mood. Children who understand their range of feelings and have experience dealing with them are better prepared to deal with the ups and downs of life.
* **Be A Role Model for Mental Strength:** There's no better way to teach a child than by example. To encourage mental strength in your students or children, you must demonstrate mental strength. Show them that you make self-improvement a priority in your life, and talk about your goals and steps you take to grow stronger.

## Enhancing Resilience in the Community

Community resilience is the sustained ability of a community to utilize available resources (energy, communication, transportation, food, etc.) to respond to, withstand, and recover from adverse situations (e.g. economic collapse to global catastrophic risks). Successful adaptation in the aftermath of a disaster ensures that a community can return to normal life as effortlessly as possible. Community adaptation is largely dependent on population wellness, functioning, and quality of life. As is the case when faced with any problem, a community should implement a plan of action in order to come together and rebuild after a disaster. Below are the key components necessary for a community to build collective resilience after a tragedy:

* Reduce risk and resource inequities
* Engage local people in mitigation
* Create organizational linkages
* Boost and protect social supports
* Plan for not having a plan, which requires flexibility, decision-making skills, and trusted sources of information that function in the face of unknowns.

## Promoting Mental Wellness

While Mental Health Awareness draws attention to the importance of valuing your own mental health, it is also about positively impacting the lives (and mental wellness) of the people around you. According to research on the foundation of social networks, the most important parts of establishing positive relationships are showing appreciation, being a good listener, and giving support to others when they need it. Furthermore, a strong social support network has been linked to a decrease in alcohol use, cardiovascular disease, and depressive thoughts. So do yourself and the ones around you a favor and remind them how loved and deserving they are of a little mood boost. Remember: you never know what somebody else might be going through, so your random act of kindness might make a world of difference.

## What Builds Resilient Relationships?

Resilience is a very important aspect of any relationship. Relationships require ongoing attention and cultivation, especially during times of adversity. Have you ever wondered what makes some friendships or romantic relationships more likely to survive than others? Below, suggests certain factors which seem to foster resiliency in relationships, and increase their likelihood of survival.

* **Active Optimism:** Active optimism is not just hoping that things will turn out well, rather, it is believing that things will turn out well and then taking action that will lead to a better outcome. In a relationship, this means an agreement to avoid critical, hurtful, cynical comments, and to instead, work together to harness the power of a positive self-fulfilling prophecy.
* **Honesty, Integrity, Accepting Responsibility for One's Actions, and the Willingness to Forgive:** When we commit to accepting responsibility for our actions, being loyal to one another and forgiving each other (and ourselves), we are bound to cultivate resilience within our relationships. This includes the old adage that honesty is the best policy, regardless of the outcome and consequences.
* **Decisiveness:** This means having the courage to take action, even when the action is unpopular or provokes anxiety in a relationship. Decisive action sometimes means leaving a toxic relationship or one that is not serving you well anymore, often times promoting one's own personal resilience.
* **Tenacity:** Tenacity is to persevere, especially in the face of discouragement, setbacks, and failures. It is important in relationships to remember that there will always be ebbs and flows, good times as well as hard times.
* **Self-Control:** As it pertains to relationships, the ability to control impulses, resist temptations and delay gratification are clearly important qualities. Self-control helps one to avoid practices that will negatively impact their relationship, while promoting healthy practices, especially in the face of adversity.
* **Interpersonal Connectedness Through Honest Communication:** The sense of belonging" and connectedness in a relationship is maintained and honed through open, honest communication. Often times the most difficult conversations to have are the most important ones.
* **Presence of Mind:** Present mindedness has many positive implications for the individual, and this is also true for partners in a relationship. Present-minded awareness within a relationship leads to a calm, non-non-judgmental thinking style and open communication. Presence of mind enables collaborative thinking and openness to new solutions, rather than shooting them down and projecting blame.

## How Do People Learn to Become Resilient for Life?

If you want to become resilient for life, it's best to start with building your resilience in the present moment! Practice and commitment to the strategies and tips discussed above, will over time increase your ability to bounce back and adapt once life has presented you with hardships. The silver lining to experiencing adverse life events is that the more you are able to flex your resiliency muscle, the better you will be able to bounce back again the next time life throws you a curveball!

## Improving Mental Stamina

`Stamina` is defined by The Oxford Dictionary as the ability to sustain prolonged physical or mental effort. Mental Stamina is the single defining trait that enables us to endure the adversities of life. It is essential for withstanding both long-term challenges or unforeseen and unexpected struggles, concerns or trauma, and is only developed by practice and repetition. Mental stamina requires planning, strength, perseverance, and concentration.

## Enhancing Resilience in the Community

Community resilience is the sustained ability of a community to utilize available resources (energy, communication, transportation, food, etc.) to respond to, withstand, and recover from adverse situations (e.g. economic collapse to global catastrophic risks). Successful adaptation in the aftermath of a disaster ensures that a community can return to normal life as effortlessly as possible. Community adaptation is largely dependent on population wellness, functioning, and quality of life. As is the case when faced with any problem, a community should implement a plan of action in order to come together and rebuild after a disaster.

##  How to Be Mentally Strong

Mental Strength is the capacity of an individual to deal effectively with stressors, pressures and challenges and perform to the best of their ability, irrespective of the circumstances in which they find themselves. Building mental strength is fundamental to living your best life. Just as we go to the gym and lift weights in order to build our physical muscles, we must also develop our mental health through the use of mental tools and techniques. Optimal mental health helps us to live a life that we love, have meaningful social connections, and positive self-esteem. It also aids in our ability to take risks, try new things, and cope with any difficult situations that life may throw at us.

##  How to Get a Better, Stronger and More Confident Mind

Confidence is one of the 4C's of mental toughness! Nurturing a positive self-view and developing confidence in your ability to solve problems and in trusting your instincts, is one of the main factors in building resiliency. Here are some surefire ways that you can begin building your confidence:

* **Get Things Done:** Confidence and accomplishment go hand-in-hand. Accomplishing goals, and even taking small steps towards your goals, can help build your self-esteem and confidence in your abilities.
* **Monitor Your Progress:** When working towards a goal, big or small, it is important to break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. In doing so, one will find it easier to monitor their progress and build confidence as they see the progress happening in real time. It helps to quantify your goals, as well as the actionable steps towards those goals.
* **Do The Right Thing:** Highly confident people tend to live by a value system and make decisions based on that value system, even when it's not necessarily in their best interest. When your decisions are aligned with your highest self, it can cultivate a more confident mind.
* **Exercise:** Exercise not only benefits your physical body but your mind as well. Mental benefits of exercise include improved focus, memory retention, and stress and anxiety management. Exercise is also said to prevent and aid in depression. Confidence from exercising comes not only from the physical, visible benefits but also from the mental benefits.
* **Be Fearless:** To be fearless in the pursuit of your dreams and goals requires a level of confidence. Conversely, challenging yourself by diving head first into things that scare you, will help to build your confidence. Often when we set big goals for ourselves it is easy to get overwhelmed and be fearful of failure. In these instances, it is important to gather up your courage and just keep going, one step at a time.
* **Stand-up For Yourself:** To stand up for yourself when someone tells you that you can't accomplish something is an effective way to develop your confidence. All too often we may end up believing the naysayers, as they are echoing the self-doubt we may be hearing in our heads. To nurture a positive self-view is to replace those negative thoughts with positive ones. Try to do so as well when someone does not believe in you.
* **Follow Through:** Following through on what you say you're going to do, not only helps to earn the respect of others but also respect for and confidence in yourself. Developing your follow-through skills will also help you accomplish your goals and likely strengthen your relationships, too.
* **Think Long-term:** Often times, we trade in long-term happiness for more immediate gratification. We can build up our confidence by making sacrifices and decisions based on long-term goals rather than short-term comforts. Finding the discipline to do so will bring greater happiness in the long-term and a higher likelihood of achieving the goals you've set for yourself.
* **Don't Care What Others Think:** It is easy to fall into the trap of wondering what others may think of you, but it's important to remember that what others think actually means nothing in the pursuit of your dreams. Build your confidence by believing in yourself and continuing to move forward, even when others might not agree with you.
* **Do More Of What Makes You Happy:** When we take time for self-care and doing the things that bring us joy, it helps to enrich our lives and becomes our best selves. Confidence comes when we are aligned with our highest selves and proud of it.

##  Building Resilience in Adults

As mentioned earlier, mental resilience is not a trait that people either have or don't have. Rather, it involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that can be learned and developed in everyone. Of course, there may be a genetic component to a person's level of mental resilience, but it is certainly something that can be built upon.

##  Resilience Training Activities and Exercises for the Community

Coincidentally, games are a great way to teach resilience. Here are some suggestions for your community:

* **Boosting Resilience Through Creativity:** Creativity is a resource for coping with stress and increasing resilience. It can be picking up a new creative habit, or seeing things in a different way. Get outside your comfort zone to explore with a new craft activity. Consider taking a class or buying tools at a craft store to try something new: drawing, painting, sketching, clay, sewing. YouTube provides many DIY craft ideas and project ranging in skill level, cost, and commitment investment.
* **Collage:** Collect scraps of ideas, magazine pictures, words, symbols, images, nature items, leaves, petals, etc. Don't look for immediate connections, yet be open to allowing these scraps to overlap in new ways. Combining ideas and creating new patterns are key practices of creativity. Use the items to make a collage and let the theme emerge.
* **Mirror Strengths Activity:** Adults have the opportunity to help children boost their sense of resilience. Resilience researchers discovered that the most meaningful situational protective factor for developing resilience is one or more caring, believing alternate mirrors. A powerful activity is to recognize and reflect back to a child his or her strengths. Make it a priority to be intentional and explicit to mirror the strengths of children in your life, by communicating: I see what is right with you, despite your struggles. And I believe what is right with you is more powerful than anything that is wrong."

##  Classroom Activities

Here are some classroom activities that can help promote self-reflection and build resilience in children:

* **Promote self-reflection through literary essays or small-group discussions:** After children have read a book or heard a story that features a heroic character, encourage them to reflect by answering the following questions:
    * Who was the hero in this story? Why?
    * What challenge or dilemma did the hero overcome?
    * What personal strengths did the hero possess? What choices did he or she have to make?
    * How did other people support the hero?
    * What did the hero learn?
    * How do we use the same personal strengths when we overcome obstacles in our own lives? Can you share some examples?
* **Encourage reflection through personal essays:** Writing stories about personal strength can help reinforce resilience building activities for youth. By exploring answers to the following questions, they can foster insight of their strengths and what need in healthy relationships with others:
    * Write about a person who supported you during a particularly stressful or traumatic time. How did they help you overcome this challenge? What did you learn about yourself?
    * Write about a friend that you supported as he or she went through a stressful event. What did you do that most helped your friend? What did you learn about yourself?
    * Write about a time in your life when you had to cope with a difficult situation. What helped and hindered you as you overcame this challenge? What learning did you take away that will help you in the future?
* **Schedule discussions about human resilience into the classroom:** In order to raise awareness, schedule class time to discuss how resilience is connected to personal success and positive social change. Share examples of figures they are familiar with and how they overcame obstacles to reach their goals.

##  Master Resilience Training (MRT) Exercises Used in the Army

The Army has incorporated the basic principles of Positive Psychology to develop the Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program. Positive Psychology's areas of focus include building mental toughness as well as identifying signature strengths, meaning, purpose and positive relationships. Soldiers learn a series of skills to enhance their resilience through some exercises:

* **ABC Activity:** The ABC cognitive reframing technique involves recognizing thoughts triggered by events and understanding the reactions that are driven by those thoughts. Soldiers learn to recognize an activating event (A), their beliefs (B) about the event, and the emotional and behavioral consequences (C) of those thoughts. Examples provided teach how to separate the events from self talk in the heat of the moment and how these thoughts impact emotions and behaviors. They learn to identify thought patterns that are driving adaptive as well as counterproductive outcomes.
* **Explanatory styles and thinking traps:** Participants learn how explanatory and other thinking patterns can enhance leadership, performance, and mental health or undermine them. Thinking traps such as jumping to conclusions are identified as examples and they can detract from resilience. Participants consider examples of thinking traps and the impact it has on others. In doing so, they can identify their deeply held beliefs, referenced as icebergs (e.g., "I can handle whatever comes my way" or "Asking for help is a sign of weakness") and core values (e.g., "People should be treated with dignity and respect" or "We should strive for forgiveness and mercy"). They learn to recognize when these icebergs are contributing to out-of-proportion emotion. Once the iceberg is identified, they assess:
    * if the iceberg continues to be meaningful to them
    * if the iceberg is accurate in the given situation
    * if the iceberg is overly rigid, and
    * if the iceberg is useful.
    Participants reflect on how these beliefs contribute to or undermine their effectiveness.
* **Energy management:** Participants learn the importance of rejuvenation to maintain energy and resilience. They learn strategies to recover and replenish one's resources (prayer, exercise, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, etc).
* **Problem-solving:** This activity involves a six-step model of problem-solving used to recognize the contributing causes of a problem and to identify solution strategies. Participants learn about confirmation bias (the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms what one already believes) and how it detracts from objectivity.
* **Minimizing catastrophic thinking:** Participants also learn about catastrophic thinking, or ruminating about worst-case scenarios. They watch videos and discuss examples of catastrophic thinking, evaluating the impact this thinking on has on energy, focus, problem-solving, and emotions. A three-step model is taught:
    * Capturing catastrophic thinking
    * Generating a best-case possibility, and
    * Fighting back against counterproductive thoughts in real-time.
    They learn to challenge negative thoughts in a systematic way.
* **Cultivating gratitude:** Participants complete a gratitude or three blessings" journal. This activity is referred to as "hunt the good stuff." The purpose of the exercise is to enhance positive emotions, particularly gratitude.
* **Identifying Character Strengths:** Participants identify their top character strengths, identify strengths in others, and practice using individual strengths and team strengths to overcome a challenge and reach a goal.
* **Strengthening Relationships:** Soldiers are provided with practical tools that help in building relationships. They learn the process of challenge beliefs that interfere with positive communication. Through role-plays, they review communication patterns and their impact. They complete an exercise identifying their typical ways of responding and also use worksheets to help clarify how they can use their strengths to respond more constructively.
