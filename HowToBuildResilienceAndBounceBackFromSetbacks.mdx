Life is full of unexpected twists and turns. Sometimes things don't go as planned. Whether it's a personal setback, a professional disappointment, or a global crisis, we all face challenges that can knock us off our feet. But what separates those who thrive from those who struggle? It's the ability to bounce back from adversity. This is where resilience comes in.

## What is Resilience?

Resilience is the ability to adapt and recover from difficult situations. It's not about being immune to stress or pain, but rather about developing the skills and mindset to cope with adversity and move forward. In today's fast-paced and ever-changing world, building resilience is more important than ever.

## Why is Building Resilience Important?

Learning how to build resilience is important because it empowers you to navigate life's challenges with greater ease, recover from setbacks, and feel better. Setbacks are one of life's certainties and a universal part of the human experience, but research shows that resilience can help you bounce back, reduce the effects of stress, and improve your overall well-being.

## How to Build Resilience

Good news: Everyone can build resilience with practice and support. Here are some strategies for developing your resilience muscle:

### 1. Practice Acceptance

During difficult times, it's natural to feel disappointed or frustrated, and worry about what's to come. These emotions can be uncomfortable but they're normal. While your instincts may tell you to avoid, eliminate, or suppress difficult feelings, that can actually make things worse. Instead, try mindfulness as a way to accept what's happened.

Observe your thoughts and feelings without trying to change them or labeling them as good or bad. Pay attention to your physical sensations as well. Is your jaw tight? Are you clenching your shoulders? Noticing, identifying, and not judging signs of physical distress can help you accept what's happened without having to approve of it so that it can pass.

### 2. Focus on What You Can Control

When you think decisions are out of your hands, it can feel like you're drifting. Focusing on what you can control and recognizing your ability to change course can be empowering.

Adversity can undermine confidence in your ability to change your circumstances. For example, if you feel blindsided by a negative performance review, you may start to worry that no matter your efforts, you're destined to fail. But those worries aren't only inaccurate, they can lead to dangerous inaction.

Building resilience can involve shifting your perspective. For example, you could respond to a negative performance review by recognizing that it doesn't define your future success and reframing it as an opportunity for growth rather than a confirmation of failure.

### 3. Work Toward a New Goal

Another resilience strategy is setting a new goal. Maybe you want to hone a new skill, find a different job, start dating again, or mend a relationship. Is there a hobby, cause, or interest you've neglected? Working toward a goal can help you refocus on your values and inspire you to move forward.

### 4. Think Optimistically

Your attitude matters when you're learning how to build resilience. Some people think you're either naturally pessimistic or optimistic, without much ability to change, or that optimism is just a naive view of the world. The truth is optimism is based on how we make sense of what happens to us. Some positive psychology researchers describe optimism as the three Ps:

* **Personalization:** Acknowledge your efforts and successes and understand setbacks involve multiple factors.
* **Pervasiveness:** View setbacks as disappointing in one area of life rather than defining your identity.
* **Permanence:** Recognize hardships as temporary and changeable, focusing on positive qualities and potential for improvement.

### 5. Connect with Others

Building resilience isn't something we tackle alone. Our connections with friends, family, and colleagues are important in helping us get through tough times. It's not just having trusted people in our lives, it's genuinely connecting with them so they can validate our attempts, reframe challenges, and encourage us.

When asking loved ones for support, it helps to be specific about your needs. You may ask friends or family to offer words of encouragement, keep you accountable, or even lend a helping hand as you pursue new goals. Asking for concrete types of support will help reduce ambiguity about how people can best help you and improve the chances that their attempts are worthwhile.

### 6. Take Care of Yourself

Prioritizing self-care helps to reduce stress, enhance emotional well-being, and maintain a positive outlook. By investing in self-care practices like getting plenty of sleep and doing things you enjoy, you'll fill your tank so when tough times come around, you're not facing them empty.

### 7. Work on Problem-Solving Skills

Problem-solving skills empower us to tackle challenges and find solutions rather than feeling overwhelmed. Examples of problem-solving skills include breaking down complex issues into manageable steps and seeking different perspectives.

### 8. Get Professional Help

Talking to a mental health professional can be a powerful resilience strategy. Resilience doesn't mean that you should be able to withstand major stressors without professional help. A therapist can help you address the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors fueling your distress and support you in building a life that's defined by your goals and values, rather than by your adversity.

## You Can Do This

Building resilience can help you move through difficulties and thrive in the face of adversity. Sadness, anger, grief, frustration, and disappointment are inevitable. But resilience can help you cope with those emotions and motivate you to take the right steps.
