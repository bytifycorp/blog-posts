Have you ever felt like a fraud, even when you're achieving great things? You're not alone. Imposter syndrome is a common experience that affects people from all walks of life. It's that nagging feeling that you're not as smart, talented, or capable as others perceive you to be. You might worry that you'll be "found out" as a fake, even though you have evidence of your success.

Imposter syndrome can be a real challenge, but it's important to remember that it's not a reflection of your true abilities. It's a thought pattern that can be overcome with the right strategies.

## What is Imposter Syndrome?

Imposter syndrome is a psychological phenomenon that involves persistent feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt despite evident achievements. People with imposter syndrome often attribute their successes to luck or external factors, disregarding their own competence. This internalized sense of fraudulence can lead to anxiety, fear of exposure, and a cycle of overworking to prove oneself.

## Signs of Imposter Syndrome

Here are some common signs of imposter syndrome:

* **Persistent self-doubt:** You constantly question your abilities, even when there's evidence of your competence.
* **Fear of failure:** The thought of failing can be so scary that it stops you from trying new things.
* **Undervaluing contributions:** You find it hard to accept that you played a key role in the success and tend to shrug off compliments or downplay your contributions.
* **Overachievement:** You set extremely high standards for yourself, and even if you meet those standards, you still don't feel good enough.
* **Fear of being exposed:** The dread that someone will discover you're a fraud or not as skilled as people think you are can be so overwhelming, you work harder and longer to combat the fear, but it doesn't go away.

## How Imposter Syndrome Impacts Mental Health

Imposter syndrome can have a significant impact on your mental health. It can lead to:

* **Anxiety:** Constantly worrying about being exposed as deceptive or not living up to expectations can stir up anxiety, making it tough to stay calm and focused.
* **Depression:** Over time, the negative thoughts and self-doubt that come with imposter syndrome could pull you into a depressive episode. It's draining to feel continuously inadequate, no matter how hard you work or how much you achieve.
* **Stress:** Striving for perfection or fearing failure can increase your stress levels due to the pressure of keeping up appearances or meeting impossibly high standards.
* **Burnout:** Imposter syndrome can push you to work harder and longer to prove your worth, which can lead to burnout.
* **Low self-esteem:** When you're constantly doubting your abilities or attributing your success to external factors, your self-esteem can take a hit. Feeling good about yourself is hard when imposter syndrome makes you feel you're not good enough.
* **Delayed personal growth:** Imposter syndrome can limit your potential. The fear of failure may stop you from taking on new challenges or opportunities that could hinder personal or professional growth.
* **Relationship strain:** The stress and self-doubt from imposter syndrome can spill over into your relationships potentially causing relationship anxiety and maybe even making it hard to accept love or praise from others, because you may not feel deserving.

## 8 Tips to Overcome Imposter Syndrome

Tackling imposter syndrome requires awareness, effort, and patience. But there are straightforward steps to guide you in overcoming this psychological struggle.

1. **Learn to recognize when you're experiencing imposter syndrome**
Recognize your feelings of imposter syndrome when they arise, and write them down. Taking time to name your feelings and what triggered the emotions can help bring clarity to how and why you're feeling this way. Practice mindfulness to keep your thoughts from drifting into self-doubt and stay present in connections with others and in connection with yourself.

2. **Challenge your inner critic**
If you're prone to negative self-talk, encourage yourself to challenge those beliefs and shift them to something more positive. If you feel like you're not good enough, ask yourself if you actually have evidence to support this feeling? Or if you're just stuck in a cycle of self-doubt. Making mistakes is a part of learning and growing. Embrace them, learn from them, and move forward.

3. **Try reframing your views**
Feeling imposter syndrome does not mean you are weak, or a failure, it's actually just an opportunity to grow. When you feel those moments of self-doubt try reframing the situation. Where are the opportunities to grow and learn? Focus on those. If all else fails, lean into self-care and self-reflection practices so that you can work to strengthen your self-esteem and self-confidence.

4. **Seek support to manage negative feelings**
Share your thoughts with someone you trust, or consider talking to a professional. It's easy to feel like an imposter here, too-thinking your feelings or issues aren't significant enough. But reaching out for support is a valuable step in managing your feelings, no matter how big or small they might seem to others.

5. **Practice the SBNRR technique**
This technique is a simple method to use in responding to imposter thought patterns in a more mindful way.
* **Stop:** Halt the negative thought in its tracks.
* **Breathe:** Take a few deep breaths to calm your mind.
* **Notice:** Observe your thoughts without labeling them as good or bad.
* **Reflect:** Consider why this thought happened and whether it's true.
* **Respond:** Choose how to respond to this thought in a supportive way.

6. **Acknowledge what you've achieved**
Celebrate your wins-all of them! Acknowledging what you do well is a way to remind yourself of your abilities and contributions. Remind yourself of your abilities and achievements daily. Write down what you're good at and revisit this list often.

7. **Keep a digital folder of praise**
Keep a folder on your device of all your accomplishments, or praise you've received in your personal and professional life. This way, when you feel imposter syndrome kick in, you can boost your confidence and self-belief by reading how accomplished you are.

8. **Practice self-compassion**
Self-compassion is so important, especially when you're worried you don't measure up. Treat yourself with the same compassion and understanding you'd offer a friend.

##  Overcoming Imposter Syndrome: Seven Strategies That Can Help

As with all negative emotions, one of the best ways to manage impostor feelings is to address the cognitive distortions contributing to them.

1. **Learn the facts**
As with all negative emotions, one of the best ways to manage impostor feelings is to address the cognitive distortions contributing to them.

2. **Share your feelings**
Be strategic about who you share with.

3. **Celebrate your successes**
People who struggle with impostor feelings tend to brush off their successes, which only exacerbates the experience.

4. **Let go of perfectionism**
You don't have to lower the bar, but adjusting your standards for success can make it easier to see and internalize your accomplishments.

5. **Cultivate self-compassion**
Self-compassion as Ervin describes it, using mindfulness to shift from an external locus of self-worth to an internal one-can help you let go of perfectionism.

6. **Share your failures**
Hearing what other people think of you isn't the only way to grow out of impostor phenomenon.

7. **Accept it**
As you learn to work through impostor phenomenon, it will probably interfere less with your well-being. But taming impostor feelings doesn't mean they'll never show up again.

## The Five Types of Imposter Syndrome

According to researcher Dr. Valerie Young, there are five impostor types:

1. **The Perfectionist.** This type of imposter syndrome involves believing that, unless you were absolutely perfect, you could have done better. You feel like an imposter because your perfectionistic traits make you believe that you're not as good as others might think you are.
2. **The Expert.** The expert feels like an imposter because they don't know everything there is to know about a particular subject or topic, or they haven't mastered every step in a process. Because there is more for them to learn, they don't feel as if they've reached the rank of "expert."
3. **The Natural Genius.** In this imposter syndrome type, you may feel like a fraud simply because you don't believe that you are naturally intelligent or competent. If you don't get something right the first time around or it takes you longer to master a skill, you feel like an imposter.
4. **The Soloist.** It's also possible to feel like an imposter if you had to ask for help to reach a certain level or status. Since you couldn't get there on your own, you question your competence or abilities.
5. **The Superperson.** This type of imposter syndrome involves believing that you must be the hardest worker or reach the highest levels of achievement possible and, if you don't, you are a fraud.

## How Do I Know If I Have Imposter Syndrome?

If you wonder whether you might have imposter syndrome, ask yourself the following questions:

* Do you agonize over even the smallest mistakes or flaws in your work?
* Do you attribute your success to luck or outside factors?
* Are you sensitive to even constructive criticism?
* Do you feel like you will inevitably be found out as a phony?
* Do you downplay your own expertise, even in areas where you are genuinely more skilled than others?

If you often find yourself feeling like you are a fraud or an imposter, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist. The negative thinking, self-doubt, and self-sabotage that often characterize imposter syndrome can affect many areas of your life.

## What Does Imposter Syndrome Feel Like?

Some common characteristics of imposter syndrome include:

* An inability to realistically assess your competence and skills
* Attributing your success to external factors
* Berating your performance
* Fear that you won't live up to expectations
* Overachieving
* Sabotaging your own success
* Self-doubt
* Setting very challenging goals and feeling disappointed when you fall short

## Impact of Imposter Syndrome

For some people, impostor syndrome can fuel motivation to achieve, but this usually comes at the cost of experiencing constant anxiety. You might over-prepare or work much harder than necessary, for instance, to "make sure" nobody finds out you are a fraud. Eventually, anxiety worsens and may lead to depression.

## What Causes It?

In the earliest studies, researchers found that imposter syndrome was connected to factors including early family dynamics and gender stereotypes. Subsequent research has shown, however, that the phenomenon occurs in people of all backgrounds, ages, and genders.

* **Family Upbringing**
Research suggests that upbringing and family dynamics can play an important role in imposter syndrome. Specifically, parenting styles characterized by being controlling or overprotective may contribute to the development of imposter syndrome in children.
* **New Work or School Opportunities**
We also know that entering a new role can trigger impostor syndrome. For example, starting college might leave you feeling as though you don't belong and are not capable. You may also experience the same feelings when starting a new position at work.
* **Personality**
Certain personality traits have also been linked to a higher risk of experiencing imposter syndrome. Some traits or characteristics that might play a role include:
    * Low self-efficacy: Self-efficacy refers to your belief in your ability to succeed in any given situation.
    * Perfectionism: Perfectionism plays a significant role in impostor syndrome. You might think that there is some perfect "script" for conversations and that you cannot say the wrong thing. You may also have trouble asking for help from others and procrastinate due to your own high standards.
    * Neuroticism: Neuroticism is one of the big five personality dimensions that is linked to higher levels of anxiety, insecurity, tension, and guilt.
* **Social Anxiety**
Impostor syndrome and social anxiety may overlap. A person with social anxiety disorder may feel as though they don't belong in social or performance situations, for instance.

## Coping With Imposter Syndrome

To get past impostor syndrome, it helps to start asking yourself some hard questions. Here are a few to consider:

* What core beliefs do I hold about myself?
* Do I believe I am worthy of love as I am?
* Must I be perfect for others to approve of me?

To move past these feelings, you need to become comfortable confronting some of the deeply ingrained beliefs you hold about yourself. This exercise can be hard because you might not even realize that you hold them, but here are some techniques you can use:

* **Share your feelings.** Talk to other people about how you are feeling.
* **Focus on others.** While this might feel counterintuitive, try to help others in the same situation as you.
* **Assess your abilities.** If you have long-held beliefs about your incompetence in social and performance situations, make a realistic assessment of your abilities.
* **Take baby steps.** Don't focus on doing things perfectly, but rather, do things reasonably well and reward yourself for taking action.
* **Question your thoughts.** As you start to assess your abilities and take baby steps, question whether your thoughts are rational.
* **Stop comparing.** Every time you compare yourself to others in a social situation, you will find some fault with yourself that fuels the feeling of not being good enough or not belonging.
* **Use social media moderately.** We know that the overuse of social media may be related to feelings of inferiority.
* **Stop fighting your feelings.** Don't fight the feelings of not belonging.
* **Refuse to let it hold you back.** No matter how much you feel like you are a fraud or that you don't belong, don't let that stop you from pursuing your goals.

"Naming the fear can knock the wind out of it," says Owens. "Because these are internal beliefs that don't have anything to do with actual performance or abilities, most people would be surprised to learn who among them is dealing with imposter syndrome. Receiving good feedback from your peers or talking to a mental health professional about your feelings can be important and effective ways to put things in perspective."

Remember that if you are feeling like an impostor, it means you have some degree of success in your life that you are attributing to luck. Try instead to turn that feeling into one of gratitude. Look at what you have accomplished in your life and be grateful for your achievements.

Don't be held back by your fear of being found out. Instead, lean into that feeling and get to its roots. Let your guard down and allow others to see the real you. If you've done all these things and still feel like an impostor, which is holding you back, a mental health professional can help you learn how to overcome these feelings.

If you or a loved one are struggling with mental health, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

## What is imposter syndrome weakness?

Imposter syndrome can create a mental barrier that prevents you from fully acknowledging your abilities and achievements, but it also presents an opportunity for growth if you're able to reframe the situation. Rather than looking at it as a weakness, consider it an opportunity to lean into self-care and self-reflection practices to boost your self confidence.

## Is imposter syndrome just anxiety?

While imposter syndrome and anxiety might overlap, they are different. Imposter syndrome refers to feeling like a fraud despite evidence of competence, whereas anxiety is a broader term for excessive worry or fear about future events.

## What are the signs of imposter syndrome?

Signs of imposter syndrome include persistent self-doubt, fear of failure, undervaluing your contributions, overachieving to compensate for perceived inadequacies, and fearing exposure as a fraud.

##  How to Overcome Imposter Syndrome FAQs

* **How do you fix imposter syndrome?**
Fixing imposter syndrome starts with understanding what it is and acknowledging it. Recognize when and where you feel like an imposter, and try to understand the triggers. Talk about your feelings with someone you trust or a professional. Practicing self-compassion, challenging negative beliefs, and celebrating your achievements are steps in the right direction. It's a process, not a quick fix, so be patient with yourself.

* **Does imposter syndrome go away?**
Overcoming imposter syndrome can take some time and effort. It may not disappear overnight, but it can certainly become less overpowering with increased self-awareness, support, and the right strategies for you. Self-discovery and self-compassion can help reduce feelings that you're an imposter over time.

* **What is the root cause of imposter syndrome?**
The root cause of imposter syndrome can vary from person to person. It could stem from past experiences, personality traits, or external expectations. Sometimes, a high-achieving environment or a change, like a new job, can trigger these feelings. Understanding your personal triggers can help in addressing and overcoming imposter syndrome.

* **Do I have imposter syndrome, or am I just bad at something?**
It's beneficial to know the difference between experiencing imposter syndrome in a certain area of your life or needing extra time to develop a skill set. If you're doubting your abilities despite consistently receiving positive feedback and achieving goals, you might be experiencing imposter syndrome.
On the other hand, if there are clear areas for improvement in a certain area of your life, focusing on skill development can be beneficial. It might be helpful to seek feedback from trusted colleagues or a mentor to gain a better perspective.

## Remember: You're Not Alone

It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling like an imposter. Many successful people experience these feelings, and it doesn't mean you're not capable or worthy.  If you're struggling to overcome imposter syndrome on your own, consider seeking support from a mental health professional. They can provide guidance and tools to help you challenge negative thoughts and build your self-confidence.
