## Simple Meditation for Stress Management

Guided meditation and mindfulness practices have been positively connected to emotional resilience. The emotional turmoils that follow a stressful experience can
be purposefully resolved through practicing simple meditation every day.

## Understanding Resilience Theory

Resilience theory has been an intriguing field of research the last few decades. Encompassing a vast arena of empirical evidence that has been provided by
psychologists, sociologists, neuroscientists, and social workers, the resilience theory, in short, is the aggregation of the strengths that a person manifests when
dealing with uncomfortable stress.

## Key Research on Resilience Theory

* **Rutter's Theory:** Professor Michael Rutter, a child psychiatrist based in London, who has been devotedly researching on resiliency theory since the 1970s stated that: Resiliency is an interactive process that involves exposure to toxic stress that has a relatively positive outcome for the individual facing it. He found that brief exposure to risks such as temporary unemployment, natural disaster, or separation, can act as triggers and influence the resilience power we have. His findings supported the possibility of genetic influence in the amount of resilience that a person is born with. Why some people are more resilient by birth than others, is, according to his findings, due to genetic predispositions.
* **Garmezy's Theory:** Norman Garmezy, a research pioneer and a clinical psychologist at the University of Minnesota, laid his empirical findings on the theory of emotional resilience in 1991. His assertions were based on the fact that: Individual differences play a major role in determining the level of emotional resilience one has. Community, family, and the social surroundings of a person influence his temperamental abilities and shape the way he perceives stress and reacts to it. Interventions must encompass all the individual and environmental factors. Addressing any one won't help in building overall resilience power.
* **Werner's Theory:** Dr. Emmy Werner's theory on resilience was mainly focused on children, however, her findings are considered as groundbreaking in the fields of advanced social and applied psychology. Werner was the first person who identified that resilience differs with age and sex. That boys and girls of different ages have different levels of resilience, was a major focus of her research. She coined that resilience is a variable. It changes over time. With different stress encounters, we are likely to react with different levels of resiliency.
* **Ungar's Theory:** Dr. Michael Ungar, founder of the International Resilience Research Centre in Canada, and an established family therapist for over 25 years, coined the concept of 'The Seven Tensions Of Resilience', which are: Material resources, Relationships, Identity, Autonomy and Control, Social justice, Cultural conformity, Cohesion. Ungar theorized that these 7 tensions or forces that test emotional resilience are present in all cultures, but the way different individuals react to the same experience is influenced by his cultural beliefs and manifestations.

## Resilience in Social Work

Emotional resilience is promoted by factors that lie within us, the factors that lie in the organization that we work in, and the educational factors. When it comes to
resilience in a profession, it is usually two-dimensional the first dimension is the experience of adverse or stressful situations, and the second one is to skillfully
cope with them.

Undoubtedly, social work is a job that requires tremendous emotional intelligence and empathy. Due to the nature of their work, social workers often need to hide
or suppress their reactions to dominating authority or the immense workload that they don't get paid for.

Doing this for years is undoubtedly stressful and can take a toll on the workers' resilience and emotional tenacity.

In several studies, researchers have devoted much of their time exploring how resiliency plays a key role in social workers who have managed to sustain the profession for years.

Their findings suggest that most successful social workers are able to employ varied coping mechanisms suited to combat emotional labor. Their wellbeing and
confidence to serve selflessly are possible only due to the fact that they are emotionally strong enough to let the stress pass away.

With an immense focus to the present, realistic expectations, and dedication toward the larger community, social workers are able to hold on to their emotional
resilience in times of trouble.

## Stress-busters For Social Workers

Social workers can successfully manage their resilience by:

* Joining and being part of a community
* Effective time management
* Emotional awareness and empathy
* Non-judgmental attitude
* Separate spaces for work and family
* Regular mindful and meditation practices
* Positive and hopeful perspective
* Proactive and ready to learn from past mistakes

##  Boosting Resilience in the Workplace

Promoting emotional resilience for employees can directly impact on their overall productivity and help them maintain a better quality of life.

Studies have shown that a large portion of employees who either get terminated or voluntarily resign from their jobs do so due to personal stressors like terminal
illness or the loss of a near one.

Today, several successful initiatives are being taken by organizations to assess the employees' and leaders' emotional health and conduct training to build their
resilience.

Developing resilience at work may seem difficult when the stress affecting work productivity is actually something unrelated to the work itself (for example
conflict with colleagues, bullying, or personal stress).

While it is undeniable that building resilience is not a quick fix that starts working immediately, here are some ways that might help professionals to achieve
resilience in a professional setup.

## Building Resilience At Work

* **Prioritize Health:**  Make sure you are getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.
* **Cope Resiliently:**  Learn to manage your emotions effectively. This might involve deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, or other techniques.
* **Work Mindfulness:**  Focus on one task at a time.
* **Find Support:**  Build strong relationships with colleagues and friends.

##  Developing Emotional Resilience

Developing emotional resilience is a matter of being aware of our inner potentials. The only thing that differentiates an emotionally resilient and an emotionally fragile
person is the way the former chooses to 'respond'.

Emotional resilience doesn't mean that stress won't affect us or losses won't depress us, it only implies that we still have the vision to stand up right back and keep
moving ahead.
