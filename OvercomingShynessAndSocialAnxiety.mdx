We all experience moments of shyness, nervousness, or anxiety around social events. Sometimes it can be as simple as butterflies in the stomach when expecting to meet new people at a party. But for some, social anxiety can be a debilitating condition that significantly impacts their daily lives.

Social anxiety disorder, sometimes referred to as social phobia, is a type of clinical anxiety disorder whereby an individual's persistent fear of being watched or judged by others impedes everyday functioning. Individuals with this disorder may ruminate on planned social events weeks in advance and may actively avoid social situations completely. The disorder can be so intrusive and cause such distress to individuals that even simple tasks, such as buying groceries or visiting family, are impossible to do.

## Understanding the Difference Between Social Anxiety and Social Anxiety Disorder

It's important to understand the difference between social anxiety and social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety is a common experience that most people have from time to time. It's characterized by feelings of nervousness, self-consciousness, and discomfort in social situations. Social anxiety disorder, on the other hand, is a more severe condition that involves intense fear and avoidance of social situations.

## Symptoms of Social Anxiety

The symptoms of mild social anxiety can be easy to identify: sweaty palms, a racing heart, shortness of breath, worrying, a racing mind, and butterflies in the stomach. These are fairly generic symptoms that occur when the autonomic nervous system (ANS; our fight-or-flight system) becomes activated, and the body is flooded with epinephrine (adrenaline).

##  Coping with Social Anxiety at Work

When those familiar feelings of anxiety emerge at work, individuals face a tough decision: to struggle ahead in silence or take a timeout. Ideally, this is the ability to step away and take a few minutes to apply grounding techniques. It is strongly recommended that all organizations and employers build supportive cultures where individuals feel able to take such a break.

## Strategies for Reducing Workplace Anxiety

To calm anxious feelings at work, individuals can tap into several key techniques that should help to turn things around quickly. The primary aim here is to activate the PNS. When feeling anxious, it is hard to feel grounded. The mind is spiraling with unhelpful thoughts.

### Grounding Techniques

Grounding techniques work by helping the mind focus on the body and the present moment. This can help you feel calmer and more centered.

#### Breathing Techniques

The breath is miraculous! By simply concentrating on breathing, the nervous system can be actively downregulated, and within no time at all, anxious moments may dissipate. One example is to breathe in for four seconds, hold the breath for four seconds, and breathe out slowly over a count of eight seconds. There are many variations of this breathing technique, but essentially, breathing out for longer than breathing in helps slow a racing heart.

#### Touch

Touching the body can be an excellent way to soothe and calm the nervous system, particularly areas that are not associated with anxiety. This includes rubbing your earlobes or elbows, which cannot themselves hold tension or anxiety in them. Touch is powerful; it is often used in therapeutic settings for the very purpose of relieving anxiety and has also been effective in reducing pain.

#### Counting

When feeling anxious, individuals should try to distract the mind from worrying. An alternative and equally effective technique to breathing exercises is to focus on counting. Counting can be particularly powerful when paired with observation of the surroundings. A popular example is to find five things that can be seen, four things that can be felt, three things that can be heard, two things that can be smelled, and one thing that can be tasted. When doing this exercise, try to be as specific as possible and provide lots of detail with what is sensed.

## Social Anxiety and Public Speaking

Public speaking can be frightening, often resulting in performance anxiety. It's so intimidating in fact, that researchers often use the notion of having to speak in public to induce individuals into stressful states during experiments. Indeed, public speaking is the ultimate trigger for social anxiety because it involves purposefully exposing oneself to the opinions and judgments of others.

### Tips and Strategies for Delivering a Confident Speech

* **Prepare well:** Practice, practice, practice! This might be an obvious tip, but by rehearsing the speech more confidence is built about delivering the speech. This confidence can help offset some of the nervousness experienced.
* **Manage breathing:** Engage in breathing exercises before delivering the speech. As mentioned earlier, slowing down breathing is a simple yet powerful way to downregulate the body. When feeling those familiar anxiety symptoms before giving a speech, practice slow, deep breaths. Pair this with any of the aforementioned grounding or relaxation techniques to amplify the benefits and bring you back into the present moment.
* **Burn energy:** Harness some of that nervous energy and take action. Do star jumps or jumping jacks before the speech to blow off steam. During the speech, individuals can move around and gesture to consume even more nervous energy.
* **Visualize success:** Before the event, spend a few minutes visualizing the delivery of a successful speech or presentation. Imagine the audience responding positively and see yourself feeling calm and collected.

## Can You Overcome Social Anxiety? 3 Techniques

If you recognize yourself as someone who often experiences social anxiety and are wondering what other steps you can take to reduce the frequency and/or intensity of these experiences, the key resides in being proactive. Given that it is not possible to avoid stressful events, the focus should be to learn how to better cope with them. By building internal resources, a stressful event can be navigated with ease.

### Preventive Practices

* **Physical exercise:** The benefits of regular exercise to both physical and mental health are well documented. By acting as a protective buffer against disease and psychological distress, exercise is one surefire way to bolster internal resources. Exercise boosts the experience of positive emotions, which in turn helps accrue psychological resources.
* **Mindfulness practice:** Mindfulness is another superpower that can help stock up internal resources. If engaging in a regular practice, users can expect a cascade of positive outcomes, including reduced depressive and anxious symptoms and increased positive mood, compassion, and resilience. Even 10 minutes a day of mindfulness practice can drastically improve both physical and psychological functioning. The beauty of mindfulness is that it does not have to be practiced as a formal meditation. Rather, it can take many forms, including mindfulness walking or listening to music.
* **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy:** Sometimes, in order to counteract anxiety, you might want to look more closely at patterns of thinking. Given that activation of the autonomic nervous system and symptoms of anxiety occur because we interpret an event as stressful, it stands to reason that interpretations may not always be on point. When this happens, engaging with Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be a real game changer. CBT is often employed as a treatment for anxiety and works by challenging thinking patterns and helping individuals shift their mindsets. Useful CBT techniques include writing down thoughts and then gently challenging the veracity of them, and learning positive coping mechanisms such as cognitive reframing.

## Self-Help Exercises for Managing Social Anxiety

To aid your client in finding tools that will help them manage their social anxiety, the following self-help worksheets can be instrumental in helping them find coping mechanisms or understand their anxiety better.

### Observing Anxiety Mindfully

This worksheet helps clients identify and observe how anxiety feels in the body. Clients are encouraged to explore the different sensations that arise in the body when thinking about a stressful social situation. Once the sensations have been observed, clients are encouraged to accept and sit with the feelings and sensations of anxiety from a place of nonjudgment, as with any mindfulness practice. Lastly, clients are invited to use visualization to further tap into self-compassion and recognize the transient nature of anxiety.

### Anxiety Record

The Anxiety Record is an effective worksheet that allows a client to capture step by step what happens when they experience anxiety. The first step is to identify the stressor, before noting down anxious feelings and whether thoughts are helpful or realistic. The client is then invited to identify more helpful thoughts when facing anxious moments and ways to regain a sense of control when feeling carried away with anxious thoughts.

### Creating a Mindfulness Anxiety Plan

One excellent way to prepare for upcoming social situations is to create a mindfulness anxiety plan. Mindfulness has a powerful impact on building coping skills, and it also enhances the ability to sit with discomfort without getting swept away by feelings.

##  Additional Tips for Overcoming Shyness and Social Anxiety

* **Don't focus on yourself:** It's hard to stop the endless mind chatter when you're in situations that make you particularly anxious. We often turn inward and focus on ourselves and how others will perceive us, almost always assuming it will be negative. The thought that everyone will be looking at you when you walk into a room and judging you in one way or another? This isn't the case. Stop focusing on yourself and what other people are thinking of you. Focus on other people, try to be present, and make genuine connections. No one's perfect, so try to be in the moment and actually listen to what is being said.
* **Adopt a healthier lifestyle to reduce anxiety:** The mind and body are linked, and how you treat your body can have a significant impact on the rest of your life, including your anxiety levels. Making small lifestyle changes can help to improve your self-confidence and your ability to cope with anxiety symptoms. Avoid or limit your caffeine intake by not drinking coffee or caffeinated drinks after a certain time. Energy drinks act as a stimulant and can increase anxiety symptoms. Make physical exercise a priority in your day and always try to be active at some point; even taking a brisk walk during your lunch hour is a great way to fit it in.
* **Take a breath:** The physical symptoms of anxiety include increased heart rate, pounding chest, dizziness, and muscle tension. Learning to take a minute and slow down your breath can help you take back control of your body. Simply take a seat, get comfortable, and take the biggest breath you've taken all day and hold it in for four seconds. Then exhale slowly, pushing out as much air as possible. Take another deep breath filling the stomach with air and continue until you feel your breath slowing down to its normal rate.
* **Act confidently:** There are a large number of adults suffering from social phobia and crippling shyness. You can learn to be confident in the same way you learned to ride a bike. Act more confidently, and people will react positively. This doesn't mean you need to be the class clown or the center of attention. It's just about being more assertive. Something that feels terrifying at first will gradually feel better each time.
* **Find social situations and engage:** Make a conscious effort to be more social. Actively look for supportive social environments that can help you overcome your fears. Perhaps start with a social skills training class. Here you can properly practice your social interactions before heading out into the real world. This will give you some tips on what to say and do when you find yourself in a social situation you're unfamiliar with or anxious about.
* **Be kind to yourself:** Nobody's perfect, and everyone feels embarrassed at one point or another in their life. Overcoming social anxiety is by no means easy. You'll have times where you think negatively and slip back into old habits. If you're feeling run down or tired, you may find yourself feeling more anxious than normal, but it doesn't mean you've failed. Just take a minute, focus on the present, and practice the techniques you've been working on.
* **Talk:** By overcoming social anxiety and shyness, you will hopefully start feeling more confident during conversations. Talking to someone can be very challenging, and knowing what to say isn't easy. Sometimes an awkward silence can feel like it lasts a lifetime. Talking to people gradually will help you be less anxious each time.
* **Face your fears:** The final step is to face your fears. It's impossible to overcome social anxiety if you don't expose yourself to situations that make you anxious. By using avoidance as a tool to cope, you won't be helping yourself or encouraging personal growth. Numerous studies have shown that exposure therapy, facing your fears, is effective in treating anxiety disorders. Research does suggest, however, that exposure should be applied gently. Therefore take part in a social interaction or activity that only slightly provokes your anxiety and work your way up.
* **Overcoming social anxiety is a long journey, and it takes time for new neural pathways for social interactions to form.** Is your social anxiety constantly interfering with your daily life? Then don't hesitate to seek professional help in whatever form you feel comfortable looking for. These are great ways to help overcome your social anxiety. Although it seems like an impossible obstacle, it's so worth overcoming, so you can live your life to the fullest.
