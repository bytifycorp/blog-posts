#  Next.js Performance Optimization: A Comprehensive Guide

Have you ever built a Next.js application and wondered why it's not as fast as you'd like? You're not alone. While Next.js is a powerful framework, it's easy to create applications that are slow and sluggish. But don't worry, there are a number of techniques you can use to optimize your Next.js app and make it blazing fast.

In this blog post, we'll explore some of the best practices for optimizing Next.js applications. We'll cover everything from server-side rendering to lazy loading, and we'll provide code examples to help you get started.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering is a technique that renders the initial HTML of a webpage on the server before sending it to the browser. This can significantly improve the perceived performance of your application, especially on mobile devices.

Next.js provides a function called `getServerSideProps` that you can use to render any page on the server and return static HTML to the client. You can do your data-fetching work inside this function. The `getServerSideProps` function takes a context object as a parameter that contains page data such as params, res, req, query, etc. This function will be called by the server on every request, returning an object that will be passed to the page component as a prop. In other words, this function allows you to fetch your data from the API and return the fetched data to the page component as a prop.

Here's an example of how to use `getServerSideProps`:

```javascript
// This function will be called by the server
export async function getServerSideProps({context}) {
  // Fetch data from external API
  const data = await fetch(`YOUR_API`)
  // Returning the fetched data
  return { props: { data } }
}

function SSRPage({ data }) {
  // Displaying the data to the client
  return(
    <div>{data}</div>
  )
}

export default SSRPage
```

In the above example, whenever the user visits the SSR page, the `getServerSideProps()` function will be called by the server and will return the fully rendered static page.

## Dynamic Imports

Traditionally, applications load all the components and the CSS required by the application in the initial load. Dynamic imports allow you to split your code into small chunks and load them on demand. In the context of web applications, this means that you can import specific components on an as-needed basis. If a user never interacts with a particular component, that component will never be loaded. This can be a huge performance boost, especially on mobile devices. This will also reduce the initial load time and the overall bundle size of the application.

For example, if the user hasn't logged in, you can lazy load the login component. To use dynamic import, you just need to import the code using an ES2020 dynamic import.

```javascript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
import SimpleButton from '../components/Buttons'
const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/LoginButton'))

function Program() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SimpleButton />
      <DynamicComponent />
    </div>
  )
}

export default Program
```

In the above code, we are using the dynamic component provided by the framework to load our login button dynamically. You can pass a component name, an array of module names, and a function inside the component that will be invoked when the module is loaded.

## Caching Frequently Used Content

Caching improves response times and reduces bandwidth usage by serving content from a cache instead of the original source. Next.js has built-in caching so pages load faster. To implement caching in your Next.js application, you can manually set the headers on any API routes that retrieve content and server-side rendered props to use Cache-Control.

Here's an example of how to use caching for API routes:

```javascript
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 's-maxage=10');
}
```

For server-side rendering:

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps({ req, res }) {
  res.setHeader(
    'Cache-Control',
    'public, s-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate=59'
  )
  return {
    props: {},
  }
}
```

For static files and assets, you don't have to manually add caching; Next.js automatically adds them.

## Removing Unused Dependencies

Many applications depend on third-party packages. While dependencies are definitely good for your app, they increase its size and loading time. If you are using npm packages in your Next.js application, you should watch for unused dependencies. They take up space in your final bundle and might cause unexpected behaviors in your application.

If you have a small project, you can easily find the unused dependencies and remove them from the package.json file of your Next.js app. But if you have a large project with lots of different dependencies, it may be difficult to find the unused dependencies. In this case, you can use a tool to find unused dependencies in your project.

I recommend that you remove dependencies one by one and restart your application after each removal to ensure that the dependency was truly not needed and that you didn't break your application.

## Optimizing Images

Image optimization involves reducing the size of an image file. Because images are one of the biggest assets weighing down your app's performance, reducing the size of image files can improve performance. This is a two-step process: 1) resize the image to a smaller size and 2) save it in the correct format (jpeg is better for photos; png is better for graphics).

Next.js provides an inbuilt `next/image` component that we can use in place of the native `<img>` component.

```javascript
import Image from 'next/image'

function OptimizedImage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Next.js Image</h1>
      <Image
        src={image_url}
        alt="Any Text"
        width={500}
        height={500}
        blurDataURL="URL"
        placeholder="blur"
      />
    </>
  )
}

export default OptimizedImage
```

Now let's look at the benefits of the `next/image` component.

* **Lazy loading:** Lazy loading is the process of loading a particular chunk of an app only when it is visible in the client viewport. By default, the `next/image` component lazy loads images, which will decrease the loading time. If you don't want to lazy load an image, set `priority={true}` to turn it off.
* **Placeholder images:** Using the `next/image` component, you can add a blurred placeholder for any image using the `placeholder` prop.

If you have multiple images in a page, you can prioritize loading using the `next/image` component.

## Optimizing Your Scripts

In addition to npm dependencies, many applications use third-party scripts like Google Analytics, Google AdSense, and Bootstrap. These scripts can further slow your Next.js app. Instead of using the default `<script>` tag, you can use the `next/script` component of Next.js. It allows you to set the loading priority for third-party scripts.

For example:

```javascript
import Script from 'next/script'

export default function OptimizedScript() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        id="YOUR ID"
        src="URL"
        onError={(err) => {
          console.error('Error', err)
        }}
        onLoad={() => {
          // Function to perform after loading the script
        }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

By setting the value of the `strategy` prop in the `next/script` component, you can use three different script loading approaches:

* `afterInteractive`: The script will be loaded on the client side after the page becomes interactive.
* `beforeInteractive`: The script will be loaded on the server side before self-bundled JavaScript is executed.
* `lazyOnload`: The script will be loaded after all other resources are loaded.

After applying one of these strategies, check the speed and performance of your app using web performance tools like Google pagespeed. A web performance tool can provide valuable information about application performance, such as:

* The time it takes to get the initial page.
* The time it takes to get the initial resources.
* The number of round trips transmitted.
* The amount of data transferred each trip.

## Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a technique that loads resources only when they are needed. This can significantly improve the performance of your application, especially on mobile devices.

Next.js provides a function called `next/dynamic` that you can use to lazy load components. This function takes a function as a parameter that returns a promise that resolves to the component you want to lazy load.

Here's an example of how to use `next/dynamic`:

```javascript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const PDFModal = dynamic(() => import('@/components/optimization/PDFModal'), {ssr: false});
```

By doing this, when the browser runs the javascript for the page, it applies lazy loading for the `PDFModal` component and only includes them when they are needed.
