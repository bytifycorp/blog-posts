### Getting Started with Ruby

You're probably excited to dive into Ruby and unlock its magic. But where do you begin?

Here's a simple guide to help you start your Ruby journey:

1. **Install Ruby:** Download and install Ruby on your operating system. Many resources provide detailed guides and installation instructions for different platforms. 

2. **Open IRB (Interactive Ruby):** Once you've installed Ruby, open the Interactive Ruby environment (IRB). IRB is your playground where you can experiment with Ruby code and see the results immediately.  

3. **"Hello World!"**  It's a tradition to start with the classic "Hello World!" program. In Ruby, you can print it to the console using the `puts` command:
```ruby
puts "Hello World!"
```
4. **Basic Operations:**  Experiment with basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and data types in IRB:
```ruby
puts 10 + 5  # Outputs 15
puts 20 - 10 # Outputs 10
puts 3 * 4   # Outputs 12

# Variable assignment
name = "Alice"
puts "Hello, #{name}!" # Outputs "Hello, Alice!"
```

5. **Explore Resources:**  There are countless online resources available for learning Ruby, from interactive tutorials to detailed documentation. Explore these resources, join online communities, and ask for help when you need it.
