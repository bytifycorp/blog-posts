* **JavaScript Functionality:**

 ```javascript
const waterInput = document.getElementById("water");
const exerciseInput = document.getElementById("exercise");
const bloodSugarInput = document.getElementById("blood-sugar");
const submitButton = document.getElementById("submit");
const logData = document.getElementById("log-data");

submitButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
  const date = new Date();
  const formattedDate = date.toLocaleDateString();

  const waterIntake = waterInput.value;
  const exerciseDuration = exerciseInput.value;
  const bloodSugarLevel = bloodSugarInput.value;

  const logEntry = {
    date: formattedDate,
    waterIntake: waterIntake,
    exerciseDuration: exerciseDuration,
    bloodSugarLevel: bloodSugarLevel
  };

  const existingLogData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("logData")) || [];
  existingLogData.push(logEntry);
  localStorage.setItem("logData", JSON.stringify(existingLogData));

  renderLogData(existingLogData);
  clearInputs();
});

function renderLogData(logData) {
  logData.forEach(entry => {
    const newRow = logData.insertRow();
    const dateCell = newRow.insertCell();
    const waterIntakeCell = newRow.insertCell();
    const exerciseDurationCell = newRow.insertCell();
    const bloodSugarLevelCell = newRow.insertCell();

    dateCell.textContent = entry.date;
    waterIntakeCell.textContent = entry.waterIntake;
    exerciseDurationCell.textContent = entry.exerciseDuration;
    bloodSugarLevelCell.textContent = entry.bloodSugarLevel;
  });
}

function clearInputs() {
  waterInput.value = "";
  exerciseInput.value = "";
  bloodSugarInput.value = "";
}

// Load previous data from local storage
const storedLogData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("logData")) || [];
renderLogData(storedLogData);
 ```

This example demonstrates a rudimentary fitness tracker that allows users to input their daily water intake, exercise duration, and blood sugar level.  It stores this data in the browser's local storage and displays it in a table.  While simple, this code provides a solid foundation for building a more feature-rich fitness tracker.
