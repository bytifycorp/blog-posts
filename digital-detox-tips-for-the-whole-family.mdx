The modern world is awash in screens. They’re on our walls, our tables, in our cars, and in our hands.  Technology has undeniably made our lives easier and more convenient, but its constant presence can also come with a cost.  As parents, we often feel overwhelmed by the pervasive influence of screens on our children's lives and wonder how to create a healthy balance.  What we need, it seems, is a digital detox, not just for ourselves but for our whole family.

## The Case for Digital Detox: Why We Need to Disconnect

The reasons for considering a family digital detox are compelling and go far beyond simply limiting screen time.   Here’s what I’ve learned from my own journey, and what’s been reinforced by the research: 

* **Mental and Emotional Well-being:** Spending excessive time in front of screens can lead to negative consequences.  It can contribute to a range of emotional issues, including attention-deficit, social isolation, impaired brain development, and even sleep disruptions.  These effects can spill over into real-life, impacting everything from school performance to social interactions and even basic mood regulation. 
* **Physical Health Concerns:** Digital devices and screen time can have tangible impacts on our physical health.  Too much screen time can mean less time for physical activity, which can lead to issues like obesity and other health problems.  Even when we’re not actively using our phones, simply having them present can subtly affect our brains, making us less present and engaged in real-life interactions. 
* **The Importance of Family Time:** It’s not just about our individual well-being; the quality of our family time is affected too.  Digital devices can become a distraction during meals, leading to rushed meals and missed opportunities for conversation and connection.  Moreover, our own use of screens can set a negative example for our children, encouraging their own excessive screen time. 
* **Cultivating a More Balanced Life:** Digital detox isn’t just about getting away from screens for a bit; it’s about creating healthier habits for interacting with technology in the long run.  By developing strategies for managing screen time, we can foster a more balanced life, allowing for more real-life experiences, social interactions, and meaningful connections.

## Digital Detox Tips for the Whole Family

So, what can we do to create a healthier relationship with technology, for ourselves and our children?  Here are some tips,  strategies, and activities to create a successful family digital detox: 

### The Planning Stage

1. **Log the Hours:**  Start by acknowledging the problem. Encourage everyone in the family to keep track of their screen time for a day or week.  You might be surprised by how much time you all actually spend on digital devices!  
2. **Bucket List:**  Next, brainstorm! Encourage each family member to create a list of screen-free activities they'd love to do. This can be a great way to spark ideas and inspire everyone.  Some suggestions might include:
     * Family outings
     * New hobbies 
     * Sports or fitness goals
     * Creative projects
     *  Reading
     * Home improvement projects
     * Cooking
     *  Adventures

3. **Plug in Together:**  Put chargers in a central location in the house, such as a kitchen counter.  This discourages everyone from bringing their devices into bedrooms, creating more family-friendly zones.
4. **Turn Off WiFi:** Make it a habit to switch off the WiFi at night, creating a designated “screens-off” zone.  Establish an hour before bedtime as a no-screen time, encouraging everyone to unwind with calming activities like reading, listening to music, or journaling.

###  Tech Habits and Choices

5. **Let Go of Apps:**  Have each family member look at their phone’s apps.  Which ones are essential?  Which ones are a waste of time or causing additional stress?  Challenge everyone to identify at least three apps to trash, offload, or take a break from for the detox period.
6. **Turn Off Notifications:**  For the apps you do decide to keep,  consider if you really need all those notifications popping up.  Turning off notifications can help everyone be more focused and less distracted. 
7. **Phone-Free Day:** Designate a whole day as phone-free.  Go on a family outing, work on a big project around the house, or try a screen-free activity.  Then, discuss your experiences and what you learned about being off screens for a while.

###  Digital Detox Strategies

8. **Science of Screens:** Discuss with children the potential negative effects of screen time on the brain. This could include information about how screen time can alter the development of young brains and contribute to a chemical addiction to social media.
9. **Brain Hacks:**  Encourage everyone to explore ways to boost their brain’s “happiness chemicals” without relying on screens.  There are many healthy alternatives that don’t require an internet connection! 
10. **Vintage Devices:**  Get creative with technology from another era!  Break out those dusty old CD players, tape recorders, or even a rotary phone.   These activities can spark fun and unique ways to engage with the world without relying on screens. 
11. **Online Safety Talk:**  Have a conversation about online safety, covering the pros and cons of making friends online, and the importance of privacy and security.
12. **IRL Friendship:**  Encourage children to find ways to connect with friends offline.  They could send postcards, handwritten letters, or even plan a get-together. 
13. **Library Haul:**  Plan a visit to the library! This can be a fun and enriching experience that allows for reading, learning, exploring, and connecting as a family.
14. **Parental Controls:**  Take a look at the parental control settings on your devices and apps.  Make sure they are in place and provide appropriate restrictions for your children.  
15. **Visual Inspiration:**  Encourage family members to explore non-digital ways to express their creativity.  Try drawing, painting, sculpting, or even working with a traditional camera.

### Engaging and Fun Activities

16. **Audio Exploration:** Listen to audiobooks, kids’ story podcasts, family-friendly news podcasts, or parenting podcasts together.  Audio provides a great alternative to visual media.
17. **Interview an Elder:**  Have a conversation with someone who grew up before smartphones.  You might be surprised by the stories of a time without Google Maps and instant communication!
18. **Address FOMO:**  If kids are feeling anxious about missing out on things while they’re taking a break from screens, address their FOMO with open communication.  Help them understand that there’s plenty to experience in the real world and social media isn’t the only source of happiness.
19. **Media Review:**  Have each family member make a list of the TV shows, video games, YouTube channels, news sites, etc., that they spend a significant amount of time on. Then discuss how these media sources affect their lives, and consider cutting back on those that don't lead to positive outcomes.

###  Encouraging Positive Habits

20. **Hold a Contest:**  If your family is competitive, host a challenge to see who can go the longest without their phones or tablets.  Setting a goal and a prize can be an exciting way to encourage digital detox!
21. **Turn Off Auto-Play:**  Make sure to turn off auto-play features on video streaming platforms.  This can help you avoid getting sucked into watching way more content than you initially intended. 
22. **Phone Hiding Spot:**  Designate a place to store phones away during family bonding time or homework, such as a drawer or a box. 
23. **Ad Exercise:** Have the family brainstorm all the ads they can remember seeing without turning on screens.  This will increase awareness of the constant onslaught of advertising and how much time we spend absorbing its messages.
24. **Start a Bulletin Board:**  Create a family bulletin board where everyone can share ideas, plans, notes, and artwork. 
25. **Password Update:**  Strengthen passwords and enable two-step verification on all devices.  Discuss with your children the importance of protecting their personal information online.
26. **Recycle Old Devices:** Find a local recycling center and dispose of old phones, computers, and chargers as a family.   This is a great opportunity to talk about the impact of technology on the environment. 
27. **Code of Conduct:**  Create a family agreement or contract about appropriate technology use.  This can include a list of rules for safe and healthy technology use.
28. **Set Limits:**  Use screen time management apps to set limits for daily screen time or to track your family’s overall tech use.
