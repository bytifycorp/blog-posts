"Big, fat Indian wedding" is a phrase that conjures up images of vibrant colors, intricate decor, and an abundance of delicious food. It's a dream scenario, but reality bites when it comes to budget. It's a common misconception that a budget-friendly wedding can't be grand or exquisite. This couldn't be further from the truth. 

My sister is getting married this summer, and as I help plan her bridal shower, I'm reminded of the magic and joy of weddings. It's also a reminder of how expensive they can be. I remember back when I got married how much I wanted to DIY, and how I made it a point to save money on things that I felt I could do myself. I have a deep-rooted love for all things DIY, and I believe that a wedding shouldn't leave you in debt just because you want to make it your own. 

So, how can you make your wedding a grand affair while sticking to a budget? The answer lies in creative DIY projects and a little bit of resourcefulness.  I've compiled a list of ideas from wedding experts and real-life couples who made their wedding dreams come true without breaking the bank. 

## **The DIY Wedding Decor Mindset**

Here's a key principle to keep in mind: prioritizing your DIY projects. Before you dive into any project, it's important to have a clear vision of the overall aesthetic you want to achieve.  This approach will help you avoid getting overwhelmed and ensure that your decorations complement each other seamlessly.  A balanced and harmonious design will elevate your wedding without compromising on the budget.

##  **Where to Begin?**

Here are some starting points that will set you on the right track:

- **Start with the Venue:** Your wedding venue can set the tone for the entire event. If it boasts built-in décor or eye-catching surroundings, you can achieve an expensive look without spending a fortune on additional décor. A beautiful outdoor space, like an open-air garden, can create a breathtaking backdrop for all your photos while saving you money.

- **Get Creative with Fabrics:** Light, airy fabrics like sheer white fabric can be draped on wedding arches, pews, doorways, ceilings, walls, and more.  This inexpensive material can create a sophisticated wedding atmosphere without breaking the bank.  Similarly, table runners add a pop of color for a low price and can be used to accent drapery or for other DIY projects.

- **Embrace the Power of Candles:** The magical interplay of flame and reflective surfaces creates a beautiful ambiance. Votive candles are inexpensive and versatile. Use them at the altar, on the cake table, at the bar, and even on the dance floor to create a warm glow.  Similarly, use square mirrors to add a touch of elegance and reflect the candlelight.

## ** DIY Wedding Decor Hacks**

Here are a few DIY hacks that will create a truly unique and unforgettable wedding experience:

- **Rethink Your Altar's Shape:**  Think outside the box!  A wedding circle made from palm fronds and white roses is a unique and budget-friendly alternative to a traditional arch.  

- **Go Boho:**  A triangular altar with a dream catcher as the focal point can evoke a bohemian vibe.  Add vintage furniture pieces, potted plants, and rustic rugs to create a welcoming atmosphere.

- **Dress Up the Bridal Seat:**  Go beyond blooms!  A tulle chairback décor pays tribute to the bride's wedding style.  Other creative ideas include hanging childhood photos, nickname signs, or monogrammed blankets.

- **Double Duty Centerpieces:**  Make your centerpieces work twice as hard.  Use arrangements that can be used at the foot of each aisle for the wedding ceremony and then repurposed as table centerpieces for your wedding reception.

- **Use the Power of Greenery:** Greenery can add a lush, romantic touch to any wedding.  Use it to create a soft backdrop, drape it around your venue, or arrange it in simple vases.  Greenery can also be used to create a lush aisle runner or to enhance your flower arrangements.

- **Create Floating Decor:**  Floating candles and flowers in cylinders of varying heights are a budget-friendly way to create a sophisticated and elegant look.  Consider using any type of flower except those that produce a lot of pollen, which can cloud the water.

- **Embrace Natural Elements:**   Go wild with nature's gifts! Fresh fruits, eucalyptus leaves, pine cones, driftwood, feathers, and palm fronds are all creative additions to your décor.

- **Personalize Your Place Cards:**  Get creative with your place cards!  Turn a simple piece of paper into a work of art by adding a photo, a note, or a small baked treat.  Use natural elements like leaves, stones, or shells to add a unique touch.

## **Additional Tips for Saving Money**

- **Repurpose Wine Bottles:**  Put those empty wine bottles to good use!  Paint table numbers on them, fill them with flowers, or use them as water carafes for the tables.

- **Upcycle Furniture:**  Transform vintage furniture like a dresser or a bookshelf into a petal station, escort card displays, or bar elements.

- **Hand-Stamp Wax Seals:**  Add a luxe touch to your wedding stationery or paper products with custom wax seals. 

- **Sprinkle in Some Lavender:**  Lavender is a versatile and aromatic addition to your wedding décor.  Fill bowls, garnish cakes and cocktails, or create sachet favors with this fragrant herb.

- **Define a Path with Lanterns:**  Create a magical path by illuminating the pathway with paper lanterns. Your guests will thank you when they're trying to find the restrooms!

- **Create a Visual Guestbook:**  Encourage your guests to snap Polaroids of themselves on the big day and add the photos to a keepsake book. 

- **Construct a Reception Table Canopy:**  If your outdoor venue doesn't have a trellis, create your own!  A custom canopy, adorned with lush greenery and flowers, can add a touch of elegance and grandeur.

- **Get Artsy with Leaves:**  Make use of nature's bounty! Leaves are a perfect, natural canvas for escort cards, table numbers, exit tosses, and chargers.

- **Visualize Your Table Settings:**  Don't overcomplicate your table settings.   The essentials include plates, utensils, napkins, and a place card. 

- **Garnish with Fresh Herbs:**  Enhance your table settings with the fragrance and beauty of fresh herbs.

- **Accent with Fresh Fruit:**  Incorporate fresh fruit into your tablescapes and centerpieces for a pop of color and seasonal flavor.

- **Cluster Floral Centerpieces:**  Create a full centerpiece without breaking your budget.   Mix bud vases, glass bottles, and other odds and ends from around your home for a colorful and eclectic look.

- **Craft One-of-a-Kind Place Cards:**  Use just about any object that matches the theme as long as you can write on it or have it hold a card.

- **Set Out Colored Taper Candles:**  Add a warm glow and a touch of elegance to your wedding with colored taper candles.  

- **Turn Napkins into Cutlery Holders:**  Why burden your budget with extra props when you already have everything you need?  Fold your napkins in a unique way to create a pocket for your menu card or cutlery. 

- **Embellish with Candleholders:**  Add height and dimension to your wedding décor by using candleholders. Mix and match hues and sizes for a cool, eclectic arrangement.

- **Exhibit Potted Plants:**  Potted plants add a fresh, earthy spin on the more conventional floral arrangements. Use them for aisle runners, table ends, or centerpieces.

- **Grow Your Own Grass:**  Have a green thumb?  Grow your own plants for the wedding and then enjoy them at home or in your garden after the event.

- **Dress Up Sweetheart Chairs:**  Outfit the newlyweds' place of honor with macrame wall hangings or signs that say "Mrs." and "Mr."

- **Experiment with Table Runners:**  From gauzy fabrics to trails of moss and ivy vines, the possibilities are endless.  Choose a runner that complements your wedding style and theme.

- **Don't Forget the Table Ends:**  Don't neglect those table ends!   Anchor those designs from the ground up by using the same flowers, greenery, and tones for your table ends. 

- **Dangle String Lights:**  Experiment with hanging string lights vertically for a whimsical and magical effect.

- **Don't Be Intimidated by Drapery:**  Drapery can add softness, intimacy, and a light and airy mood to your wedding space.

- **Source a Cake Topper:**  Go the minimal route when it comes to your cake topper.

- **Lay Out the Sweets:**  Create a beautiful and inviting dessert bar with a sampling of sweets.
