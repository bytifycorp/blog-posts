## Your Guide to a Lifetime of Wellness: Essential Health Screenings for Women at Every Age

It's amazing how quickly time flies. One minute you're a carefree teenager, the next you're celebrating a milestone birthday and wondering if you've been taking good care of yourself.  As a woman, the journey of navigating health screenings can sometimes feel overwhelming, but it's truly a gift to invest in preventive care.  Understanding the essential screenings recommended at different stages of life empowers us to make informed decisions and protect our well-being.  Let's explore this journey together, diving deep into the crucial health screenings for women at every age, based on the most recent medical guidelines.

### The Importance of Preventive Care: A Personal Perspective

Personally, I remember feeling a bit lost when I turned 30.  It wasn't just the social pressure to "adult" properly, but also the realization that I needed to be more proactive about my health.  It was then I finally booked my first mammogram, the first step in taking control of my own well-being.  The experience was empowering, and I felt a surge of responsibility for prioritizing my health. 

Preventive care isn't just about avoiding serious illnesses; it's about living a fuller, healthier life.  Understanding what screenings are recommended at different stages and why is the first step toward a proactive approach.  

### The First Steps: Essential Screenings for Women 18 to 39

This is the time to start building strong health habits!  It's also a period when many young women are navigating new relationships and may be dealing with a range of health concerns.

**Here's a breakdown of key screenings for women 18-39:**

* **Blood Pressure Screening:**  Your blood pressure should be checked every 3 to 5 years.  It's even more important to get it checked more often if you have certain health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, kidney issues, or are overweight.  If your top number is between 120 to 129 mm Hg or your bottom number is between 70 to 79 mm Hg, it's a good idea to get your blood pressure checked more often, especially if you have a family history of hypertension or are Black.  If your top number is 130 mm Hg or greater, but less than 140 mm Hg, or your bottom number is 80 mm Hg or greater but less than 90 mm Hg, this is considered Stage 1 Hypertension.  Consult your doctor to develop a plan to lower your blood pressure.
* **Breast Cancer Screening:**  Breast self-exams aren't universally recommended, but it's important to talk to your doctor about what is best for you.  Routine mammograms are not recommended for women under 40.  However, if you have a family history of breast cancer or carry a high-risk genetic marker, your doctor may recommend mammograms, MRIs, or ultrasounds starting earlier than the age your close relative was diagnosed.
* **Cervical Cancer Screening:**  Start cervical cancer screenings at age 21, unless your doctor advises otherwise.  For women 21-29, a Pap test should be performed every 3 years. For women 30-65, either a Pap test every 3 years or an HPV test every 5 years, or both tests every 5 years (co-testing) is recommended.  If you've been treated for cervical dysplasia, continue having Pap tests for 20 years after treatment or until age 65, whichever is longer.  If you have had a total hysterectomy (your uterus and cervix removed) and have not been diagnosed with cervical cancer or pre-cancer, then you no longer need cervical cancer screenings.
* **Cholesterol Screening:** Cholesterol screening should begin at age 45 for women with no known risk factors for coronary heart disease, and at age 20 for women with known risk factors.  Repeat cholesterol screenings every 5 years if you have normal levels.  Your doctor may recommend more frequent screenings if you experience certain conditions or are taking medications to control high cholesterol. 
* **Dental Exam:**  Don't forget about your dental health!  Visit your dentist once or twice a year for an exam and cleaning. Your dentist will evaluate if you need more frequent visits.
* **Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Screening:**  Get screened for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes starting at age 35.  Repeat screenings every 3 years if you are overweight or have obesity.  If you have a family history of diabetes, or have high blood pressure, prediabetes, or a history of heart disease, you should get screened more often. 
* **Eye Exam:**  Get an eye exam every 5 to 10 years before age 40.  If you have vision problems, get an eye exam every 2 years or more often.  It's essential to have an eye exam that includes an examination of your retina at least every year if you have diabetes.
* **Immunizations:**  It's crucial to stay up-to-date with recommended vaccines.  Get a flu shot every year.  Ask your doctor about the COVID-19 vaccine and what is best for you.  It's also important to make sure you've received the tetanus-diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, especially if you didn't receive it as an adolescent.  Get a tetanus-diphtheria booster every 10 years.  If you weren't born in 1980 or after, get 2 doses of the varicella vaccine if you never had chickenpox.  Consider receiving 2, 3, or 4 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine, depending on your circumstances.  If you aren't already immune to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), make sure you receive 1 to 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.  Your provider can tell you if you are immune.  Discuss the HPV vaccine with your doctor if you haven't already received it.
* **Infectious Disease Screening:**   For women who are sexually active, it's important to get screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea up until age 25, and women 25 years and older should be screened for these conditions if they're at high risk.  All adults ages 18 to 79 should get a one-time test for hepatitis C.  Pregnant women should be screened for hepatitis C at every pregnancy.  All people ages 15 to 65 should get a one-time test for HIV.  Remember, depending on your lifestyle and medical history, you may also need to be screened for infections such as syphilis and HIV, as well as other infections.
* **Skin Self-Exam:**  It's a great habit to make a point of checking your skin monthly for any changes or unusual moles.  Your doctor can also perform a skin self-exam during your physicals.  
* **Dental Exam:**  Go to the dentist at least once or twice a year for an exam and cleaning.
* **Physical Exam:**  All women should visit their healthcare provider from time to time, even if they're healthy. These visits are important for a range of reasons, including: screening for disease, assessing your risk of future medical problems, encouraging a healthy lifestyle, updating your vaccinations, getting preventive care services, and maintaining a relationship with your provider in case of an illness.  During your exam, your doctor may ask about your mental health, diet and exercise, alcohol and tobacco use, and any safety issues, such as your use of seat belts, smoke detectors, and your relationship status.

### From 40 to 64: Stepping into a New Era of Wellness

Once you've crossed the 40-year mark, there are a few additional screenings to consider. 

* **Mammograms:**  Mammograms are generally recommended for all women starting at age 40, and should be repeated every 1 to 2 years.  If you have a family history of breast cancer, it's a good idea to discuss more frequent screenings with your healthcare provider. 
* **Colon Cancer Screening:**  A colonoscopy is typically recommended starting at age 45.  You may need to be screened sooner if you have a family history of colorectal cancer.  
* **Osteoporosis Screening:**  If you are between 50 and 64 and have risk factors for osteoporosis, discuss screening with your doctor.  Risk factors can include long-term steroid use, low body weight, smoking, heavy alcohol use, having a fracture after age 50, or a family history of hip fracture or osteoporosis.

### Embracing the Wisdom of Age: Screenings for Women 65 and Older

As we age, our bodies change, and our healthcare needs may evolve as well.  Here are key screenings for women 65 and older:

* **Mammograms:**  Continue getting mammograms as recommended by your healthcare provider.  
* **Cervical Cancer Screening:**  Women who are 65 or older and have not been diagnosed with cervical cancer or pre-cancer after getting normal Pap test results for the past 10 years no longer need cervical cancer screening.  
* **Colon Cancer Screening:**  Continue having a colonoscopy every 10 years, unless your doctor recommends a different schedule. 
* **Bone Density Test:**  It's a good idea to have a bone density test every 5 years.  
* **Hearing Test:**  Get a hearing test every 10 years. 
* **Low-Dose Lung CT Scan:**  If you have a history of smoking, or are a current smoker, talk to your doctor about getting a low-dose lung CT scan. 
* **Dementia and Alzheimer's Screening:**  Talk to your doctor about getting screened for dementia and Alzheimer's, especially if you have a family history or have noticed any cognitive changes.
