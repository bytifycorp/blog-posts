## Etsy, eBay, and More: Selling Products as a Side Hustle - My Journey to $10,000

Have you ever dreamt of starting a side hustle that could not only bring in some extra cash but also offer the potential for a significant income stream?  I'm going to share my own journey, which started with a simple idea and a bit of hesitation. 

You see, for years, I felt like the whole idea of entrepreneurship just wasn't for me. I was comfortable in my job, and the thought of building a business seemed like a daunting, insurmountable task. But, then, everything changed. I stumbled upon an episode of a podcast, "The Fire Drill," featuring a woman who was selling printables on Etsy - and she was making good money. 

It was an "aha" moment for me. Here was a side hustle I could actually do. I knew about PDFs, I had already created some, and the thought of selling them on Etsy felt more attainable than launching a traditional business. 

That's when I decided to jump in headfirst. I joined a mastermind group with other individuals who were also eager to start selling printables on Etsy. The mastermind was a $199 investment, but looking back, it was a priceless investment in both skills and motivation. It helped me move past the fear of starting and gave me the support I needed to actually get going.

## Building My Etsy Shop: A Step-by-Step Approach

The initial steps were crucial. I started by building my Etsy shop incrementally, adding products and making adjustments each weekend. It took about three months to reach a point where my shop was bringing in a few hundred dollars a month, and I felt comfortable enough to let it ride.

It took around 10 hours a week to build my initial Etsy shop. Of course, I invested more time when first starting, but once it was launched, it only required a couple of hours a week for routine tasks like answering customer questions and making minor updates. I focused on the products I was familiar with, leveraging spreadsheets and debt-tracking methods I used to tackle our own $107,000 debt. It seemed like a good idea to help others with printables that could assist them in managing their finances. 

I also spent a lot of time studying other successful Etsy sellers, looking for ways to improve my products and increase visibility. While I'm not a graphic designer, I am an architect, so I had access to Adobe software that gave me a good head start in creating attractive, high-quality printables. 

## Reaching the $10,000 Milestone and Beyond

After about 19 months, I hit the $10,000 mark in sales on my Etsy shop. It was a surreal feeling. I was still relatively new to selling on Etsy, and the fact that I was earning a substantial income passively was a major victory. It proved that the side hustle could not only be a source of income but also a potential path to a more significant income stream. 

While the initial investment and time commitment were substantial, the learning curve wasn't too steep, and the rewards far exceeded the effort. I learned to make a decent income selling digital products on Etsy with minimal overhead, minimal marketing, and minimal time commitment.

##  Etsy vs. eBay: Which Platform Is Right for You? 

While Etsy was a great platform for me, it's not the only option for selling products as a side hustle. eBay is another popular platform that offers unique benefits and a wider audience reach. Let's break down the key pros and cons of both:

### Etsy: 

**Pros:**

* **Established Community:** Etsy has a vibrant and engaged community of buyers seeking unique handmade, vintage, and craft-related products. 
* **Easy Sign Up and Selling:** Etsy offers a simple and straightforward process for setting up your shop and listing products. You can start selling in a matter of hours if you have your product photos and descriptions ready.
* **Discount Codes and Shipping:**  Etsy allows sellers to create their own discount codes and control shipping costs, making it easy to incentivize repeat business. 
* **Low Cost to Get Set Up:** It's free to set up an Etsy shop, and the listing fees are minimal.
* **Unique Product Focus:** Etsy is specifically designed for unique, handcrafted items, making it easier to stand out from the crowd. 

**Cons:**

* **Expansion Has Reduced Support Service:**  While Etsy once offered live chat support, they have scaled back due to the increasing demand on their resources.
* **Lots of Competition:**  Etsy is known for having a significant number of sellers, making it crucial to have a strong marketing strategy. 
* **High Fees:** Etsy charges both a listing fee per item and a commission on each sale.  
* **Limited Customization:** Etsy's shop customization options are somewhat limited, especially compared to eBay's HTML customization features. 
* **No Independence:**  Etsy reserves the right to modify its fees and policies or shut down a shop without notice, leaving sellers with limited control. 

### eBay:

**Pros:**

* **Wide International Reach:** eBay is a global platform with a vast user base, increasing your potential reach and sales. 
* **Perfect for Hard-to-Value Products:** eBay allows both auction and "Buy It Now" options, ideal for items with uncertain or fluctuating value. 
* **Protection for Buyers and Sellers:**  eBay offers comprehensive protection mechanisms for both buyers and sellers, mitigating risks. 
* **Built-in SEO:** eBay has a dedicated SEO team to help drive traffic to your shop from search engines, improving organic visibility. 

**Cons:**

* **Hard to Customize Without Knowledge of HTML:**  Customizing your eBay shop often requires HTML coding knowledge, presenting a barrier for those without tech skills. 
* **Clunky Interface:**  Listing items on eBay can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process. 
* **High Percentage Commission:** eBay charges a final value fee on all sales, which includes a percentage of the product price plus shipping costs.  
* **Removal Fee:**  If you need to end an auction early, you may be charged a fee. 

## Making the Right Choice for Your Side Hustle 

Choosing the right platform for your side hustle depends on your unique circumstances. Etsy is a great option for sellers of handmade, vintage, and craft-related items, offering a focused and engaged audience. eBay is a better choice for selling a wider range of products, including hard-to-value items, and for reaching a larger global audience.

For me, Etsy was a great fit. It offered a specific niche market, a relatively simple setup process, and the potential to generate a passive income stream with minimal effort. But, if I had chosen to sell items that were not handmade or vintage, I might have been better off going with eBay.

##  My $10,000 Side Hustle: A Personal Takeaway

My journey to $10,000 in sales on Etsy taught me several valuable lessons:

* **Start Small and Build Gradually:**  There's no need to overwhelm yourself by trying to create the perfect shop or product line from the start.  Build your shop incrementally, adding new products and features as you go.
* **Focus on Your Strengths:**  Identify what you're good at and leverage those skills to create a successful side hustle.  I knew about PDFs and had already been creating some, so I used those skills to create printable products that I could sell on Etsy.
* **Study Other Successful Sellers:**  Take the time to study other successful sellers in your niche. Analyze what they're doing well, identify trends, and learn from their successes. 
* **Be Patient and Persistent:**  Building a successful side hustle takes time and effort.  There will be ups and downs, but stay focused and consistent, and you'll eventually achieve your goals.
