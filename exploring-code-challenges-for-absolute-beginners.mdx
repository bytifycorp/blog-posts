for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 15 == 0) {
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
  } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
    console.log("Buzz");
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

**5. Palindrome Checker:**

This challenge requires writing a program that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forward and backward.  

**Python Example:**

```python
def is_palindrome(word):
  reversed_word = word[::-1]
  if reversed_word == word:
    return True
  return False

print(is_palindrome("racecar")) # True 
print(is_palindrome("hello")) # False
```

**JavaScript Example:**

```javascript
function isPalindrome(word) {
  let reversed = word.split("").reverse().join("");
  if (reversed === word) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
