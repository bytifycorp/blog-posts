"One small step for man," says Neil Armstrong as he exits the lunar module and places his foot onto the moon's surface.  It was a woman who ensured that the lunar module landed safely and that the mission was a success.  

This is a story that many of us know. It's a story we've heard about in school, seen in documentaries, and perhaps even seen on a poster in our classrooms. But what we don't often hear is the untold story of women who made this amazing achievement possible -  the women who have been working behind the scenes in the world of computing for centuries, who have shaped the very fabric of this technology, and who have paved the way for those who followed. 

You might be surprised to learn that the earliest computers were actually programmed by women.  It wasn't always this way.  There was a time when programming was seen as "women's work," especially during World War II, when women were hired to perform a vital role in the war effort by working as "human computers" -  skilled mathematicians who performed calculations by hand.  The ENIAC, one of the first general-purpose electronic computers, was created by a team of women.  They were referred to as “the ENIAC girls" and their work revolutionized computer programming.  

##  The Pioneering Women of Early Computing

Let's take a trip back in time, to the early days of computing, and meet some of the women who changed the industry forever. 

* **Ada Lovelace** (1815-1852) is considered by many to be the first computer programmer.  She was a brilliant mathematician and the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron. She was tutored in mathematics from a young age and was inspired by the work of **Charles Babbage**, who was pioneering the development of mechanical computers. Ada translated a French article about Babbage's "Analytical Engine" and added detailed notes on the design of the machine.  These notes are remarkable because they envisioned what Babbage's computer could do beyond simple calculations - it could also process music, images, and even more complex tasks. It's a truly visionary vision for what a computer could do.

* **Grace Hopper** (1906-1992) was a pioneer in computer programming.  She was a Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy and is known for creating the first compiler for a programming language - FLOW-MATIC.  Prior to her work, all programming languages involved typing in numbers and symbols, which were often hard to remember. Hopper realized that it would be easier for programmers if they could type in plain English. Her efforts led to the development of COBOL, a programming language that was widely adopted in the business world and remains in use today.

* **Jean Jennings Bartik** (1924-2011) was one of the six women who programmed the ENIAC.  It was a groundbreaking achievement at the time, and these women were integral to its development.  While their contributions were often overlooked in the early days of computing, their work helped pave the way for modern software.

* **Katherine Johnson** (1918-2020) was a brilliant African-American mathematician who made vital contributions to the space program. She calculated trajectories for the Apollo 11 mission, and her work helped put the first man on the moon.

## The Unsung Heroines of the Computing Revolution

These women represent just a few of the many who made significant contributions to the world of computing.   These pioneers were not only brilliant mathematicians and scientists; they were also pioneers of a new era, and they paved the way for future generations of women in tech.  

It is important to remember these women and their contributions to computing because they have often been overlooked in the history of the field.  We need to acknowledge their work and highlight their achievements so that young women today can see themselves as pioneers in the field of computer science. 

## The Future of Women in Computing 

The computing landscape has changed, but it’s important to recognize the continuing challenges facing women in tech.  The gender disparity in the field is still significant.  

There are many factors contributing to the lack of representation of women in computing, including unconscious bias, societal expectations, and the continued prevalence of a "boys club" culture in the tech industry. But there are also many organizations working to change this, including the Association for Computing Machinery’s Council on Women in Computing, AnitaB.org, and Black Girls Code.  

We need to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for women in computing. This means working to break down stereotypes, provide mentorship opportunities, and create a culture of diversity and inclusion.  It's also important to celebrate the achievements of women in computing and inspire a new generation of women to pursue careers in tech.  

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is it important to have women in computing?**

It's important to have women in computing for a variety of reasons.  First, it is important to have diverse perspectives in the field.  Women bring unique skills, experiences, and ideas to the table.  They can help us to solve problems in new ways and develop new technologies.

Second, it's important to have role models for young women in computing.  When girls see women in leadership positions in tech, they are more likely to pursue careers in the field.  It's important to show them that they can achieve great things in computing.

Third, it's important to have a more inclusive and welcoming environment for women in computing. This means working to break down stereotypes, provide mentorship opportunities, and create a culture of diversity and inclusion. 

**How can we encourage more women to pursue careers in computing?**

There are many ways to encourage more women to pursue careers in computing.

* **Start early:** We need to start early in inspiring girls to pursue STEM careers.  We can do this by introducing girls to coding and computer science in elementary school, and by making sure that girls have access to role models in the field.

* **Break down stereotypes:** We need to challenge the stereotypes about who can be a computer programmer. We need to show girls that they can be successful in the field and that there are many different types of roles available.

* **Provide mentorship opportunities:** We need to provide more mentorship opportunities for women in tech.  This could include pairing women with experienced mentors who can guide them through their careers.

* **Create a more inclusive culture:**  We need to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for women in tech.  This means working to break down stereotypes, promote diversity, and create a culture of respect and support.

**What are some of the key challenges facing women in computing today?**

There are many challenges facing women in computing today.  These include:

* **The gender pay gap:** Women in tech often earn less than men in similar roles.

* **Lack of representation in leadership positions:** There are still far fewer women in leadership positions in tech than men.

* **Unconscious bias:**  Unconscious bias can prevent women from being hired for jobs or promoted into leadership positions.

* **Stereotypes:** Women in tech often face stereotypes about their abilities and interests.

* **Sexual harassment:**  Women in tech can face sexual harassment and other forms of discrimination.

**How can we address these challenges?**

There are many things we can do to address these challenges.  Some of the most important include:

* **Raising awareness:**  We need to raise awareness of the gender gap in computing and the challenges facing women in the field.  This could involve talking about the history of women in computing, highlighting the achievements of women in tech, and creating educational resources about the importance of diversity and inclusion.

* **Providing mentorship opportunities:**  We need to provide more mentorship opportunities for women in tech.  This could include pairing women with experienced mentors who can guide them through their careers and help them to overcome the challenges they face.

* **Creating a more inclusive culture:**  We need to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for women in tech.  This means working to break down stereotypes, promote diversity, and create a culture of respect and support.

By addressing these challenges, we can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for women in computing. We can ensure that women have the opportunity to thrive in the field and make significant contributions to the world of technology.

We have a lot of work to do, but the stories of these pioneering women give us hope for the future.
