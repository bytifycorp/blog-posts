Have you ever dreamed of traveling the world, but felt held back by the seemingly insurmountable cost?  Many of us share that feeling, often hearing the same refrain: "I just don't have enough money to travel." 

But the truth is, you don't need to be rich to experience the world!  Through years of extensive travels, my partner and I, the Frugal Travellers, have perfected the art of seeing the globe on a budget. And it's not about deprivation or missing out on amazing experiences; it's about being smart and strategic.  We're talking about savoring the journey, embracing local culture, and creating memories that last a lifetime, all while keeping your spending in check. 

In this in-depth guide, I'll share our secrets to frugal travel, weaving in personal anecdotes and practical advice that goes beyond simple tips.  Get ready to discover how to see the world on a budget, and even more importantly, how to make it an adventure that enriches your life in ways you never imagined!

## The Frugal Travel Mindset: It's Not About Sacrifice, It's About Strategy

The core of frugal travel isn't about deprivation, it's about understanding the nuances of travel costs and making strategic decisions. It's about finding value in unexpected places,  embracing alternative methods of transport, and ultimately, enjoying the journey for what it is, rather than what you think it should be. 

Here are some key principles we live by:

**Travel Slowly:**  The number one rule of frugal travel is to embrace slow travel.  Instead of rushing from one place to another, take the time to truly experience your chosen destinations.  This allows you to find hidden gems, discover local markets, and even negotiate better prices for accommodation. Remember, the less you move around, the less you spend on transport!

**Research Your Destination:** Knowledge is power!  Before you travel, dive deep into the destination's culture, history, and attractions. Understand local costs, explore free events and activities, and discover unique, authentic experiences.  We've learned that an informed traveler is a happy and budget-conscious traveler!

**Have a Travel Budget:**  A travel budget is essential for long-term travel.  While our average daily budget is around US $25 per person, your budget may differ based on your chosen destinations and travel style.  However, having a realistic budget helps you avoid financial stress, make mindful spending choices, and stay on track for the journey ahead.

**Plan Ahead:**  Planning your trip can significantly reduce costs. Booking flights in advance, especially for long-haul journeys, often yields the best prices. We've learned that booking in advance can also help you find cheaper accommodation options and secure your spot on popular tours or activities.

**Embrace the Sharing Economy:** The sharing economy has revolutionized travel, offering a plethora of budget-friendly options. Platforms like BlaBlaCar, EatWith, and RVShare connect you with locals who provide affordable rides, delicious meals, and unique experiences.  

**Cook Your Own Meals:** This might seem obvious, but it's one of the most effective ways to save on travel costs.  We've consistently found that cooking our own meals, whether in a hostel kitchen, a rented apartment, or even a campsite, is significantly cheaper than eating out. 

**Get a Job Overseas:**  Looking for a way to earn money while exploring the world?  Consider a short-term, travel-related job. Many destinations offer opportunities in hospitality, hospitality, teaching English, or even working on farms.  

**Teach English Overseas:**  Teaching English overseas can be a lucrative and rewarding experience.  With the right TEFL certification, you can find work in countries that are eager to welcome English teachers. 

**Do WWOOFing and Work on a Farm:**  WWOOFing (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) allows you to exchange your time and labor for free accommodation and meals on a farm.  It's a great way to immerse yourself in rural life, experience new cultures, and connect with nature.  

**Get Rail Passes:** If you plan to travel extensively within a region, consider investing in a rail pass.  These passes can significantly save on train travel compared to booking individual tickets. 

**Sleep in Large Dorms:**  Hostels offer the most budget-friendly accommodation, and large dorms often come with the lowest prices. While privacy is limited, the social aspect of dorms can be a rewarding part of the travel experience.

**Use Student and Other Discount Cards:**  If you’re a student, teacher, or under 26, take advantage of the many discounts offered with student/teacher/youth cards.  These cards can save you a significant amount on attractions, museums, and even travel costs.

**Get City Tourist Cards:**  For those who plan to explore a city extensively, city tourist cards are a great investment.  They offer discounted access to major attractions, museums, and often include free public transportation.

**Capitalize on Your Skills:**  Use your skills to earn money while traveling.  Offer services like writing, editing, graphic design, or even provide personal services like haircuts or massages. 

**Get Free Flights:**  Collecting points and miles can be a game-changer for frugal travelers. Sign up for travel credit cards, maximize everyday spending, and utilize online surveys and bonuses to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodations.

**Stay for Free:**  Couchsurfing is a fantastic way to save on accommodation.  This free service connects travelers with locals who offer free housing in exchange for a shared meal, a friendly conversation, or simply a good time.  

**Hitchhike:** Hitchhiking is a free way to travel, although it requires a certain level of comfort and preparation.  It's often common in countries like Central America, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and Australia.

**Take Free Walking Tours:**  Immerse yourself in local culture with free walking tours. These tours, led by passionate guides, offer a comprehensive introduction to a city's history, landmarks, and hidden gems. 

**House Sitting & Pet Sitting:**  If you're looking for extended stays in a particular location, consider house sitting or pet sitting. Websites like Trusted Housesitters and Nomador connect travelers with homeowners looking for reliable sitters in exchange for free accommodation.

**Use Your Social Network:** Don't underestimate the power of your social network.  Reach out to friends, family, and colleagues for connections in your destination. You never know who might have a spare couch, a helpful recommendation, or even a free meal waiting for you. 

**Frugal Travel Tips: Going Beyond the Basics**

- **Housesitting:**  Consider house sitting for extended stays, which allows you to trade your time and care for a home and pets in exchange for free accommodation.

## About Us

We've devoted our lives to slowly wandering the globe. We're not rich, but we want to see the world, so we get around on a budget and have spent the last 3 decades perfecting the art of Frugal Travel!

We provide travel stories, tips, advice and encouragement so you can get out there yourself!

Our goal is to share the things we’ve learnt on the road in order to help others visit their dream destinations and to show that world travel doesn’t have to cost a fortune!

## What is Frugal Travel anyway?

We travel for long periods by keeping the costs down. This doesn’t mean going without too much or missing out on the great sights there are to see out there. It means travelling smart by making the right choices for accommodation, transport and eating options.

We travel on a budget. Our average spend is $25 US a day, each. This covers everything, including transport, accommodation, eating, drinking and everyday costs. In certain parts of the world such as Europe and North America this can be a challenge but for the rest of the world this isn’t difficult at all.

In this manner, we’ve managed to travel slowly around the world, having some incredible adventures along the way.

And we’d like to show you how we do it! 

## Frugal Travel Tips section

## Is frugal travel difficult?

It’s all up to personal choice – for us, it was always about choosing to go to a cheap and cheerful local cafe rather than a Michelin-star restaurant, to take public transport rather than taxis, and to stay in budget hotels/guesthouses with a shared bathroom rather than a 5-star resort.

You can actually travel the world long term, independently for way less than it costs to live in a major capital city like London or New York.

We are currently travelling the world on around US $25 each per day. That’s only $9125 per year!

We know it’s not for everyone but even small changes in the way you travel can mean significant savings… meaning you can travel more often or for that bit longer!
