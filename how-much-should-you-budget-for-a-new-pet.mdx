It's easy to get swept up in the adorable factor and forget that pets require significant financial investment. The initial costs for a new pet can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the species and breed. But it doesn't stop there.  Ongoing expenses like food, vet care, and grooming can quickly add up, sometimes reaching thousands per year!
