Panic attacks are terrifying experiences, and they can feel overwhelming. It's like a sudden, intense rush of fear that sweeps over you, leaving you feeling breathless, dizzy, and completely out of control. The physical sensations are intense, often mimicking a heart attack, and the emotional turmoil can leave you feeling completely lost and desperate. But the good news is that there are effective ways to navigate these moments of panic and regain control, both for yourself and for those around you.

I've always been a bit of a worrier, so anxiety is something I've dealt with for as long as I can remember. But it wasn't until a few years ago that I experienced my first panic attack. I was driving home from work, and suddenly, I felt a wave of intense fear wash over me. My heart started pounding, my chest tightened, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I pulled over, completely terrified, and unsure what was happening to me. It took a while, but I eventually calmed down. Afterward, I learned a lot about panic attacks and how to manage them. I've since found that there are many ways to help yourself, and others, through those difficult moments.

## Understanding Panic Attacks:

Panic attacks are a sudden onset of intense fear or discomfort that can be incredibly overwhelming. The symptoms can feel like a heart attack, including rapid heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, dizziness, and nausea. The good news is that panic attacks are usually brief, lasting only 5 to 30 minutes, and they do not cause any long-term physical harm. However, they can be scary, and the constant worry about experiencing another attack can be incredibly debilitating.

## **How to Calm Yourself During a Panic Attack:**

When a panic attack hits, it's important to remember that you're not alone. Millions of people experience panic attacks, and there are many effective techniques to manage them. Here are some strategies that you can use to calm yourself during a panic attack:

### **1. Deep Breathing Techniques:**

Deep breathing is a powerful technique to manage panic attacks. When you're in the midst of a panic attack, your body may start hyperventilating, which can make you feel even more anxious. Deep breathing helps to slow your heart rate, regulate your breathing, and calm your nervous system.

- **Focus on your breath:** Take slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Count to four while inhaling, hold for a second, and then count to four while exhaling.
- **4-7-8 Breathing:** This technique involves inhaling for four seconds, holding your breath for seven seconds, and then exhaling slowly for eight seconds.
- **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** This technique focuses on using your diaphragm to breathe, which helps to ensure you are taking full, deep breaths.

### **2. Mindfulness Exercises:**

Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment without judgment. It can help to ground you in reality and reduce the overwhelming feelings of panic.

- **Focus on your senses:** Notice the sights, sounds, smells, and textures around you. Describe them to yourself in detail.
- **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
- **Guided Meditation:** Use recordings or online resources to guide you through a meditation session. Focus on your breath and the sensations in your body.

### **3. Grounding Techniques:**

Grounding techniques help to anchor you to the present moment and reduce feelings of detachment from reality. They can be especially helpful when experiencing panic attacks, as they help to bring you back to the here and now.

- **Grounding Chair:** Sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor. Visualize your negative energy flowing through your feet and into the ground.
- **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:**  Identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
- **Focus on a Single Object:** Choose a simple object and focus on its details, like color, shape, and texture.

### **4. Visualization:**

Visualization techniques involve creating a mental image of a calm and peaceful place. This can be a real place you love, or a place you've created in your imagination. When you feel yourself becoming overwhelmed, close your eyes and focus on this image.

- **Picture your happy place:** Visualize a place where you feel safe and relaxed. Imagine the sights, sounds, smells, and sensations of this place.
- **Visualize a Calm Scene:**  Imagine yourself in a tranquil setting, such as a serene beach, a lush forest, or a peaceful meadow.

### **5.  Reassurance and Coping Statements:**

Remind yourself that panic attacks are temporary and that you are not in danger. Repeating these phrases to yourself can help to calm your mind and reduce your fear.

- **"This too shall pass."**
- **"I am safe."**
- **"I am strong."**
- **"I can get through this."**
- **"I will be okay."**

## **How to Help Others During a Panic Attack:**

It can be frightening to watch someone experience a panic attack. Knowing how to respond in a calm and supportive way can make a big difference for them. Here are some tips on how to help someone through a panic attack:

### **1. Stay Calm and Supportive:**

Your calm demeanor will help to reduce the intensity of their anxiety. Remember that panic attacks are temporary and that the person will not be in danger.

- **Remain calm:** Avoid displaying your own anxiety, even if you feel it.
- **Provide reassurance:** Let the person know that they are safe and that the panic attack will pass.
- **Validate their feelings:** Acknowledge their experience, and let them know that you understand they are feeling overwhelmed.

### **2. Focus on Their Breathing:**

Help the person to regulate their breathing. Remind them to take deep, slow breaths, and offer techniques like diaphragmatic breathing or counting to four while inhaling and exhaling.

- **Encourage deep breathing:** Gently suggest they take slow, deep breaths.
- **Count together:** Count out loud with them while they breathe in and out.

### **3.  Use Grounding Techniques:**

Suggest grounding techniques to help them focus on the present moment and reduce their feelings of detachment from reality.

- **Focus on their senses:** Ask them to describe what they see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.
- **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:**  Guide them through the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique.

### **4.  Encourage Action:**

Instead of offering verbal reassurance, encourage the person to engage in actions that can help ground them.

- **Gentle movement:** Encourage them to stretch or move their limbs gently.
- **Physical activity:**  If possible, suggest they go for a short walk or engage in a light exercise.

### **5.  Offer a Safe Space:**

Create a calm and peaceful environment for them.  Move them to a quiet place, away from any potential triggers or distractions.

- **Find a quiet spot:**  Help them move to a calm and quiet space, free from distractions.
- **Offer a comfortable chair:** Allow them to sit in a comfortable chair with their feet flat on the floor.

### **6. Avoid Minimizing or Shaming:**

Never minimize their experience or tell them to "calm down." This can invalidate their feelings and make them feel worse. Instead, acknowledge their distress and let them know you understand.

- **Don't dismiss their feelings:**  Avoid telling them that their feelings are irrational or that there is no reason to feel afraid.
- **Validate their experience:**  Let them know that their feelings are real and that you are there to support them.

### **7.  Respect Their Needs:**

Give the person the space and support they need.  Let them know that you are there for them, but allow them to make their own choices.

- **Give them space:**  If they need to be alone, respect their wishes.
- **Offer support when needed:** Let them know that you are available if they need to talk or want to try a specific grounding technique.

## **When to Seek Professional Help:**

While panic attacks can be frightening, they are often manageable with the right support and techniques. However, if you or someone you know is experiencing frequent panic attacks, or if they interfere with daily life, it's crucial to seek professional help. A mental health professional can provide a diagnosis, create a treatment plan, and help develop coping mechanisms for managing panic attacks.

It's also important to seek medical attention immediately if the person experiencing the panic attack also experiences chest pain, nausea, or vomiting, as these could indicate a heart attack, which requires immediate medical attention.
