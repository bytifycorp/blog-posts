Financial anxiety. It's a phrase that's become increasingly familiar, especially in the wake of a global pandemic and a rapidly changing economic landscape. The feeling of being on edge about money, worried about bills, and stressed about the future can be all-consuming. 

I know this firsthand. As a financial therapist, I’ve seen the devastating impact that financial anxiety can have on people's lives. I've witnessed clients spiral into debt, struggle to sleep, and even experience physical health issues. The shame and isolation that often accompany financial anxiety can make it incredibly difficult to reach out for help.

But here's the good news: Financial anxiety is manageable, and you don't have to go through this alone. While financial concerns can feel overwhelming, there are proven strategies and tools that can help you reclaim your financial well-being.

## Understanding the Roots of Financial Anxiety

First, it's crucial to understand what fuels financial anxiety. It's not always about a lack of money. Often, it's about a deep-seated fear of the future, a feeling of being out of control, or a sense of shame associated with financial mistakes.

There are many potential triggers:

- **A history of deprivation:** Growing up in poverty or experiencing financial hardship can leave a lasting impact. The fear of going without basic necessities can become deeply ingrained, making financial anxiety a constant companion.

- **Low or unsteady income:** If your income is unpredictable, it can be hard to plan for the future and feel secure. The constant worry about making ends meet can be deeply stressful.

- **Rising expenses:** The increasing cost of living, especially in cities, can exacerbate financial anxiety. It can feel like a treadmill, constantly working hard to keep up with basic needs.

- **Debt:** Debt can be a significant source of stress, as it can feel overwhelming and difficult to manage. The constant fear of falling further behind can be debilitating.

- **A lack of personal finance education:** If you haven't received proper education about managing money, you might feel overwhelmed and insecure. 

- **A money misstep:**  Even a single financial mistake, like overspending on a credit card or making a bad investment, can trigger intense anxiety.

- **Your childhood beliefs about money:** Your family’s relationship with money, whether it was positive or negative, can significantly influence your own approach to finances.

## Breaking the Cycle: A Six-Step Action Plan 

Now that we've explored the potential triggers of financial anxiety, let's dive into the strategies that can help you break free:

**1. Figure out what, exactly, is triggering your financial anxiety:** This is the first step in managing any anxiety. Identify the specific situations, thoughts, or emotions that set off your financial anxiety. 

**2. Challenge your mental money narrative:**  Challenge those negative, self-defeating thoughts. Instead of saying, “I'm too embarrassed to ask for help,” try asking yourself, “How helpful is this thought? How true is it?” This can help you reframe your thinking and replace negativity with a more rational approach.

**3. Try body-based calming techniques:**  Financial anxiety often manifests physically, so connecting with your body can be incredibly helpful. Practice deep breathing exercises,  engage in calming physical activity (like taking a walk or shaking out your limbs), or try meditation. 

**4. Take your time learning about money:**  Financial education is important, but approaching it with a sense of urgency can be overwhelming. Break down your learning into manageable chunks, focusing on one aspect of finance at a time.

**5. Come up with your own money language:**  Financial jargon can be intimidating. Replace confusing terms with words that feel more comfortable for you.

**6. Know that it's okay if you need to seek professional help:**  If you're struggling to manage your financial anxiety on your own, don't hesitate to reach out for support. There are financial counselors and therapists who specialize in helping people overcome financial anxiety and develop healthier financial habits.

##  Additional Tips for Taming the Money Monster

Here are some additional tips that can help you manage financial anxiety:

- **Focus on the present:** It’s easy to get caught up in worrying about the future.  However, it’s important to ground yourself in the present moment and focus on what you can control right now.

- **Practice gratitude:**  Take time to acknowledge the good things in your life, even when you're struggling financially. 

- **Don't compare yourself to others:**  Social media can make it easy to compare ourselves to others, which can fuel financial anxiety. Focus on your own journey and progress.

- **Develop a support system:**  Talk to trusted friends and family members about your financial anxieties.  Sharing your concerns and worries can provide comfort and support.

- **Prioritize your mental health:**  Taking care of your mental health is crucial for managing financial anxiety.  Engage in activities that help you relax and de-stress, like exercising, meditating, or spending time in nature.

- **Set realistic goals:**  Set achievable financial goals for yourself.  Break down large, overwhelming goals into smaller, manageable steps.
