Imagine your home, a haven of comfort and peace, a sanctuary where you can truly relax and recharge. Now, imagine if that haven was filled with hidden threats – chemicals lurking in your furniture, toxins released from cleaning products, and pollutants lurking in the air you breathe.  This was my reality until I made the decision to create a non-toxic home environment for my family. 

It all started with an old, moldy downtown apartment. I started feeling off, my digestive system was acting up, and I felt a constant “icky” feeling that I couldn't shake. I was experiencing heightened environmental sensitivities, and it became clear that my health was suffering. It was then that I realized the profound impact of the unseen toxins we encounter daily.

I had always considered myself a healthy person, but I was living with a blind spot when it came to my surroundings. I focused on clean eating, regular exercise, and making sure I drank enough water, but I hadn’t considered the impact of the air I breathed, the chemicals lurking in my cleaning products, or the potential hazards in the furniture we brought into our home. 

The journey to creating a non-toxic home environment was a gradual, and sometimes challenging, process. But it was also immensely rewarding. I learned that even seemingly simple changes, like switching to plant-based cleaning products and opting for natural fibers in furniture, can significantly improve our health and well-being. 

##  Unveiling the Hidden Toxins

The truth is, indoor air can be up to five times more polluted than the air outside. This is due to the chemicals we use in our homes, from cleaning products and building materials to carpets and furnishings. 

**Here are some key areas to address when creating a non-toxic home:**

### 1.  Beware of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

VOCs are chemicals that escape or “off-gas” from certain materials and products. They can trigger a range of health problems, including allergies, asthma, and even cancer. 

Where to find them:

* **Paints and paint strippers:** Always opt for low or zero-VOC options.
* **Aerosol sprays:**  These are a common source of VOCs.
* **Air fresheners:**  Choose natural alternatives like essential oils or plants.
* **Disinfectants:** Look for plant-based cleaners or make your own!
* **Wood preservatives:**  Choose natural alternatives.

### 2.  Avoid Plastics

Plastics contain Bisphenol A (BPA) and other chemicals that can leach into our food, especially when heated. They can also release chemical pollutants into household dust.

Simple ways to say no to plastic:

* **Use reusable shopping bags.**
* **Buy glass Tupperware containers.**
* **Make your own beeswax wraps.**
* **Buy in bulk or choose refillable products.**

### 3.  Ensure Good Ventilation and Airflow

Good ventilation is crucial for removing unwanted odors, water vapor, and pollution.

* **Open windows and doors frequently.**
* **Use exhaust fans in wet areas and when cooking.**
* **Consider adding houseplants, like Devil’s ivy, Boston ferns, and spider plants, which can help purify the air.**

### 4.  Embrace HEPA Cleaning

HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters are essential for removing harmful particles from the air, including allergens and pollutants. 

* **Invest in a high-quality air purifier that uses a HEPA-certified filter.**
* **Change air filters regularly in your home’s HVAC system.**
* **Crack open windows to allow fresh air to circulate when outdoor air quality is good.**

### 5.  Seek Out Non-Toxic, Environmentally Friendly Products

Choosing eco-friendly cleaning products is crucial for reducing the use of harsh chemicals in your home. Remember, these products are not just better for your health but also for the health of your family and our planet.

* **Use plant-based cleaning products, like vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils.**
* **Look for eco-friendly cleaning products certified by reputable organizations.**

### 6.  Look for Independent Certification on Products

Independent certifications help you identify products with legitimate health and environmental credentials. They help ensure that claims of eco-friendliness and safety are backed by evidence. 

* **Look for certifications such as the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) for pillows and mattresses, and OEKO-TEX® for textiles.**

### 7.  Master Moisture Control

Mold is a major health concern in homes. 

* **Ensure proper ventilation to reduce moisture levels.**
* **Use exhaust fans in the bathroom and when cooking.**
* **Don’t leave any leaky pipes or fittings for too long.**

### 8.  Avoid Soft-Furnishing Chemical Treatments

Be wary of chemically treated soft furnishings, like those with stain-resistant, UV-resistant, antibacterial, or flame-retardant properties. These chemicals can break down into household dust, contributing to allergies, asthma, and endocrine-altering illnesses.

* **Choose natural fibers like wool, bamboo, and silk.**
* **Look for furniture made of 100% real, untreated wood.**

### 9.  Opt for Natural Materials and Fibers

Natural materials like wool, bamboo, and silk not only feel better but are also often better for you.  They have beneficial properties like flame-resistance, allergy-fighting, and antibacterial qualities.

* **Choose natural materials for furniture, bedding, and textiles whenever possible.**

### 10.  Understand the Connection Between Environmental Pollutants and Health

Our indoor environment can have a significant impact on our health.  The Australian Government and the CSIRO have documented that indoor pollution can contribute to a range of illnesses.

* **Prioritize creating a non-toxic home environment.**

##  Beyond the Basics:  

* **Switch to non-toxic personal care products.** Many beauty products contain chemicals that can off-gas into your home, affecting your health. Opt for natural and fragrance-free options whenever possible.
* **Consider buying used furniture.** It is often safer than new furniture, which may contain off-gassing chemicals.
* **Invest in an air purifier.**  Air purifiers with HEPA filters can significantly improve the air quality in your home.
* **Don't wear shoes in the house.**  Shoes can track in allergens and pollutants from outside.
* **Filter your water.**  Consider using a water filter to reduce the levels of harmful contaminants in your water.
* **Use a humidifier to maintain a comfortable humidity level.**  This can help alleviate dry skin and respiratory issues.
