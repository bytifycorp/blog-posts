The moment I truly embraced a zero-waste lifestyle, my bathroom became my battleground. It was there, surrounded by bottles and tubes of everything from shampoo to toothpaste, that the enormity of my plastic waste truly hit me. The Plastic Free July challenge had opened my eyes to the plastic we throw away, but it was seeing the volume of it in my own recycling bin that made me realize I needed to make a change.  It was a personal challenge, but one I felt was crucial for the sake of our planet. 

The journey began with simple swaps.  It was easy to replace my plastic toothbrush with a bamboo one. It wasn't just eco-friendly, it was actually more pleasant to use. The long handle felt natural in my hand, and the slightly softer bristles felt more gentle on my gums. But the real challenge, I quickly learned, was finding zero-waste options for the essential, everyday products I used: soap, toothpaste, and shampoo.  I didn’t realize how much of my waste came from simple hygiene items. 

## Zero Waste Soap: Finding Alternatives to Plastic Bottles

Soap was a good place to start. I'd grown up with bar soap, but liquid soap had become the norm in most stores. It was often cheaper and more convenient to use. But I was determined to make the switch.  

I started by searching for bars of soap without any packaging at all.  Fortunately, my local zero-waste store made it easy.  It was a joy to use a bar of soap again.  It felt more natural, and the lack of plastic packaging made me feel good.  Plus, the prices were more affordable.  A bar of soap often lasted me longer than a bottle of liquid soap, and the lack of plastic packaging made it even more eco-friendly.

However, I knew I couldn’t always rely on bar soap.  For guests, or in situations where a bar just wasn't practical, I needed a liquid soap solution.  That's when I discovered the magic of refillable liquid soap containers.   

Going to a local store that sold refillable liquid soap was a game-changer.  It was a little more expensive than buying a bottle of liquid soap from the supermarket, but the extra cost was worth it.  It meant less plastic waste, and it felt like a positive contribution to the zero-waste movement.  I  bought a large container of liquid soap for my guests, and I refilled it at the zero-waste store every few weeks.

## Zero Waste Toothbrushes:  Going Beyond Plastic

My quest to go zero waste extended to my toothbrush.  While I was excited about using a bamboo toothbrush, I soon realized it wasn’t a perfect solution.  Although it was a great alternative to plastic, bamboo toothbrushes are still disposable, and they can often have a tendency to get moldy at the handle.   

That’s when I discovered metal toothbrushes with replaceable heads. These were a bit more expensive than bamboo toothbrushes, but they were longer-lasting, and they could be made to be beautiful. I loved the sleek metal design, and the fact that the head could be replaced with a new bamboo brush meant I could extend its lifespan. 

However, I knew I couldn’t rely on a single solution.  I had to explore other options to find what truly worked for me.  The variety of options available was a testament to the growing zero-waste movement.  It was exciting to see so many people actively working to reduce their waste, and it gave me hope that zero-waste living was becoming the norm.

## Zero Waste Toothpaste:  Choosing Tablets Over Tubes

Toothpaste was the next hurdle.  I couldn't imagine how I could go zero waste with toothpaste.  How could I possibly replace the familiar tube of toothpaste with something else?  It was a big change, and it felt daunting.

Then I discovered toothpaste tablets.  These were small, solid tablets that dissolved in my mouth, leaving a clean and fresh feeling.  They were zero-waste, and they were a more sustainable option than the traditional tube.  I even found that the texture was quite similar to the toothpaste I was used to, as long as I chewed the tablets well.

I also tried tooth powder.  It was a little more abrasive and didn't taste as good as the tablets, but it was another zero-waste option.  It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it showed me that there were even more options out there.

##  Zero Waste Shampoo:  Embracing the Bar

Shampoo bars were the next frontier.  I was intrigued by the idea of using a bar of shampoo to wash my hair. It felt like a simple, natural solution, and it was a huge step towards reducing my plastic waste.

I purchased a shampoo bar from a local zero-waste store, and it was easy to use. It took a little more time than using liquid shampoo to create a lather, but the bar lasted much longer than a bottle, and the lack of plastic packaging was a big win. 

However, I soon realized that shampoo bars weren't perfect. They were a bit of a hassle to travel with, and they could be difficult to use in cramped shower stalls.   

It was time to switch to refillable liquid shampoo.  I found a zero-waste store that offered refillable shampoo bottles, and I loved it. It was still zero waste, and it was a lot more convenient to use.  

##  Zero Waste Hair Conditioner:  A DIY Hair Mask 

Hair conditioner was the final hurdle.  The options for zero-waste hair conditioner were limited, and I struggled to find a solution that worked for me.  

Then I decided to make my own DIY hair mask.  I used aloe vera, grapeseed oil, and honey—ingredients I already had on hand.  It was simple, it was natural, and it was zero waste.

This journey wasn't always easy, and there were many times when I wanted to give up.  But the more I learned, the more I realized that zero-waste living is a journey, not a destination. It's about making small changes that add up over time, and it's about finding what works best for you.   It's about embracing the possibilities, and it’s about celebrating the progress you make along the way.
