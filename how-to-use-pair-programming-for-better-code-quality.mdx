## What is Pair Programming?

In its essence, pair programming is a dynamic and collaborative process where two developers work together on a single task. One developer, known as the "driver," actively writes the code, while the other, the "navigator," reviews each line, offering feedback, suggesting improvements, and ensuring the code aligns with the overall design and project goals. 

The key to success lies in the constant communication and dynamic role switching. The driver focuses on the mechanics of coding, while the navigator provides strategic direction and helps identify potential problems.  They frequently swap roles, ensuring a balanced workflow and maximizing the benefits of shared knowledge and perspectives.
