# How to Write a Resume That Gets You Noticed: A Comprehensive Guide

It's a competitive job market out there.  You're not the only one with a great skillset and a passion for your field.  To stand out from the crowd, you need a resume that showcases your strengths and makes a lasting impression.

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a resume that gets noticed by hiring managers.  We'll cover everything from choosing the right format to highlighting your achievements and tailoring your resume to specific job requirements.  We'll also provide you with tips on how to make your resume ATS-friendly, so it can pass through the automated screening systems that many companies use.

## The Importance of a Great Resume

Your resume is your first impression on a potential employer.  It's your chance to make a good first impression and show them why you're the best candidate for the job.  A well-crafted resume should:

* **Highlight your skills and experience:**  Your resume should clearly showcase your skills and experience, and how they relate to the job you're applying for.
* **Be easy to read:**  Your resume should be well-organized and easy to read, with clear headings and bullet points.
* **Be ATS-friendly:**  Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes.  Your resume should be formatted in a way that is compatible with ATS, so it can pass through the automated screening process.

## 10 Steps to a Perfect Resume

Here are 10 steps to help you create a resume that gets noticed:

1. **Gather your essential information:**  Before you start writing your resume, take the time to gather all the necessary information.  This includes your contact information, work experience, skills, education, and any relevant awards or honors.
2. **Choose a resume format:**  There are three main resume formats: chronological, functional, and combination.  The best format for you will depend on your experience level and the job you're applying for.
    * **Chronological resume format:**  This format lists your work history in reverse chronological order, with your most recent job listed first.  It's a good choice for job seekers with a strong work history and those who want to highlight their career progression.
    * **Functional resume format:**  This format focuses on your skills rather than your work history.  It's a good choice for job seekers with limited work experience, those who are changing careers, or those who have gaps in their employment history.
    * **Combination resume format:**  This format combines elements of both the chronological and functional formats.  It's a good choice for job seekers who want to give equal focus to their skills and experience.
3. **Put your contact information at the top of your resume:**  Your contact information should be easy to find and accurate.  Include your name, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile URL.
4. **Create a compelling resume headline:**  Your resume headline should clearly identify the job title you're applying for.  It can also include your years of experience and key qualifications.
5. **Write your resume summary:**  A resume summary is a brief paragraph that provides an overview of your qualifications for the role you're applying for.  It should include your job title, years of experience, key skills, and a few of your most impressive achievements.
6. **Create your skills section:**  Your skills section should include a bulleted list of six to eight skills that describe your expertise for the desired role.  Include a mix of hard skills, soft skills, and technical skills.
7. **List your education correctly:**  Your education section should appear after your work experience.  Include the name of your degree, the name of the institution, the location of the institution, and your graduation date.
8. **Consider including additional resume sections:**  You can add additional sections to your resume, such as certifications and licenses, honors and awards, projects, publications, volunteer work, internships, and extracurricular activities.
9. **Proofread your resume and fact-check the details:**  Double-check all the information on your resume for accuracy and ensure that it is free of any errors.
10. **Tailor your resume to a specific job position:**  Tailoring your resume to each specific job is essential.  Read the job description carefully and identify the keywords that are most relevant to the job.  Make sure to include these keywords in your resume.

## How to Tailor Your Resume to a Specific Job

Tailoring your resume to each specific job is essential for getting noticed by hiring managers.  Here's how to do it:

1. **Read the job description carefully:**  Pay close attention to the keywords that are used in the job description.  These keywords are often used by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes.
2. **Use keywords in your resume:**  Include the keywords from the job description in your resume, but make sure to use them naturally and not in a way that sounds forced.
3. **Highlight your relevant skills and experience:**  Focus on the skills and experience that are most relevant to the job you're applying for.  Don't include information that is not relevant to the job.
4. **Quantify your achievements:**  Use numbers to quantify your achievements whenever possible.  This will help hiring managers understand the impact you've had in your previous roles.

## How to Write a Resume for Students with No Experience

If you're a student with no work experience, you can still create a strong resume.  Here are a few tips:

* **Focus on your education:**  Put your education section at the top of your resume.  Include details like your degree, major, relevant coursework, academic honors, and GPA.
* **Include extracurricular activities:**  List any activities you've participated in outside of class, such as clubs, sports, or student government.  Mention any leadership roles or responsibilities you've had.
* **Add volunteer work and internships:**  Include any volunteer positions or internships you've held.  These experiences show your willingness to work and learn.
* **Highlight projects and academic achievements:**  Talk about any major projects or research you've done, especially if they relate to the job you want.  Describe what you did and what you achieved.
* **Create a skills section:**  Include a list of your skills, including technical skills (like computer software) and soft skills (like teamwork and communication).
* **Write a professional summary:**  Start with a short summary that explains your career goals and your best qualities.  Make it clear why you'd be a great fit for the job.

## How to Match Your Cover Letter to Your Resume

Your cover letter is your chance to expand on your resume and provide more context to your qualifications.  Here's how to match your cover letter to your resume:

1. **Use consistent formatting:**  Use the same font, header, and layout as your resume.
2. **Use similar language:**  Include keywords and phrases from your resume in your cover letter.
3. **Expand on key points:**  Choose one or two major achievements listed on your resume and elaborate on them in your cover letter.
4. **Keep the tone the same:**  If your resume is formal, your cover letter should be too.  If it's more casual, your cover letter can be less formal as well.
5. **Address the job's needs:**  Demonstrate how your experiences make you a good fit for the job.  Show that you understand what the job involves and explain why you're the right candidate.
6. **End with a call to action:**  Conclude by expressing your enthusiasm for the role and suggesting they look at your resume for more details.  Ask them to contact you for an interview.
