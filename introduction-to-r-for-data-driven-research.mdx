###  R Fundamentals:  A Hands-on Approach

Let's dive into the fundamentals of R using a practical example. Imagine we are working with a dataset of military recruits. This dataset contains information about their age, gender, height, weight, boot type, and aerobic fitness levels. Let's explore how to import, manipulate, and visualize this data using R.

* **Importing data:** We can import the data into R using the `read.csv` function. For example:

 ```
 data <- read.csv(file = 'Recruits.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',', na.strings=c("",".","NA")) 
 ```

This code reads the data from a CSV file named `Recruits.csv`, assuming the first row contains headers (header = TRUE), separating values with commas (sep = ","), and treating empty values, periods, and "NA" as missing data (na.strings=c("",".","NA")).

* **Exploring Data:** Once the data is imported, we can explore it using the `head`, `tail`, `dim`, and `str` functions.

 ```
 head(data, 10) # Displays the first 10 rows of the dataframe
 tail(data, 5)   # Displays the last 5 rows of the dataframe
 dim(data)       # Returns the dimensions of the dataframe (rows, columns)
 str(data)       # Provides a structured summary of the dataframe, including variable names and types
 ```

* **Creating New Variables:** We can calculate new variables based on existing ones using mathematical operators and assigning them to new columns in the dataframe. For instance, to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI):

 ```
 data$bmi <- data$weight/(data$height/100)^2 # Note that the height is converted from centimeters to meters
 ```

* **Subsetting Dataframes:** We can select specific rows or columns from a dataframe using logical operators and square brackets. For example:

 ```
 data_over_25 <- data[data$age >= 25,] # Creates a new dataframe containing data for recruits over 25 years old
 ```

* **Summarizing Data:**  To get a quick overview of the data, we can use the `summary` function.

 ```
 Summary_stats_basic <- summary(data) # Provides a basic summary of the entire dataset
 Summary_stats_bmi <- summary(data$bmi) # Provides a summary of the BMI variable
 ```

* **Visualizing Data:** R's visualization capabilities are truly powerful. We can create various plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts, using the `plot`, `hist`, and `boxplot` functions.

 ```
 hist(data$bmi, breaks=5, col="blue", xlab="Body mass index (kg/m^2)", main="Histogram of BMI")
 plot(bmi~age, data=data, col="blue")
 boxplot(comfortf~bootsf+genderf, data=data)
 ```

###  Beyond the Basics:  Advanced Statistical Analysis

R goes far beyond basic data manipulation and visualization.  It provides a wide range of tools for advanced statistical analysis, including:

* **Testing for Normality:** The `hist` and `density` functions allow you to visually assess the distribution of your data and determine if it is normally distributed. The `shapiro.test` function provides a more formal statistical test for normality.

* **Comparing Means:** You can use the `t.test` function to compare the means of two groups. For example:

 ```
 t.test(bmi ~ genderf, var.equal = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95, data=data)
 ```

* **One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):**  The `aov` function allows you to compare the means of multiple groups. For example:

 ```
 anova_bmi_comf <- aov(bmi ~ comfortf, data = data) 
 summary(anova_bmi_comf)
 ```

* **Regression Analysis:** The `lm` function is a powerful tool for fitting linear regression models. For example:

 ```
 fit_comfort_age_boots_gender <- lm(comfort ~ age + genderf + bootsf, data = data)
 summary(fit_comfort_age_boots_gender)
 ```

* **Correlation Analysis:**  The `cor.test` function calculates correlations between two variables, allowing you to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between them. For example:

 ```
 cor.test(data$bmi, data$age, method = "pearson") 
 ```

* **Confidence Intervals:**  While packages can compute confidence intervals, you can also create them manually using your own code.

### Merging Dataframes: Combining Multiple Datasets

In many research projects, you may need to combine data from multiple datasets. The `merge` function provides a powerful tool for this task. For instance, imagine you have two datasets - one with concentration measurements of a drug over time, and the other with heart rate measurements for each subject.

 ```
 conc_data <- read.csv(file = 'concentration_data.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',', na.strings=c("",".","NA"))
 hr_data <- read.csv(file = 'effect_data.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',', na.strings=c("",".","NA"))
 all_data <- merge(conc_data, hr_data, all = TRUE)
 ```

The `merge` function combines the two datasets based on shared variables (in this case, subject ID), creating a single dataframe with all the relevant data.
