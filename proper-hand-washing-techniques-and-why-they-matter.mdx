When I was a kid, I remember my mom telling me to wash my hands before meals, after using the bathroom, and after playing outside.  I always knew it was important, but I never really understood *why* it was so crucial.  Now, after years of learning and working in the healthcare field, I've gained a much deeper appreciation for the power of handwashing. Itâ€™s truly one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of illness and protect ourselves and those around us. 

It's incredible how something as simple as washing our hands can have such a significant impact on our health and the health of our communities. It's not just about avoiding a cold or the flu; it's about preventing the spread of serious infections, like **meningitis**, **bronchiolitis**, **the flu**, **hepatitis A**, and various types of **diarrhea**. 

##  Understanding the Science of Germs

To fully grasp the importance of handwashing, let's delve into how germs spread:

- **Touching dirty hands:**  Germs can easily transfer from one surface to another and from person to person.  This is a primary way we pick up and spread illness.
- **Changing dirty diapers:**  Infants and young children are especially susceptible to spreading germs through their diapers.
- **Contaminated water and food:**  Unclean water and food can harbor harmful bacteria and viruses that can make us sick.
- **Coughing and sneezing:**  Tiny droplets released into the air can carry germs for a considerable distance, contaminating surfaces.
- **Contact with sick individuals:**  Contact with a sick person's body fluids, such as saliva, mucus, or blood, can readily transmit germs.
- **Contaminated surfaces:**  Germs can linger on surfaces such as doorknobs, phones, and shopping carts, waiting for a chance to spread.

##  Why Wash Your Hands?

We wash our hands because they touch everything! We pick up germs all the time, and these germs can easily enter our bodies through our eyes, nose, and mouth.   Washing our hands frequently, especially during these crucial times, can help us stay healthy and prevent the spread of illness.

* **Before, during, and after preparing food:**  Germs from unwashed hands can easily contaminate food, leading to food poisoning.
* **Before and after eating:**  We pick up germs throughout the day.  Washing our hands before and after eating helps reduce the risk of transferring these germs to our mouth.
* **After using the bathroom:**  The bathroom harbors a significant number of germs.  Always wash your hands after using the toilet.
* **Before and after caring for someone who is sick:**  When caring for a sick individual, it's essential to wash your hands frequently to prevent the spread of their illness.
* **After touching animals or their food:**  Animals, especially pets, can carry germs that can spread to humans.  Wash your hands thoroughly after touching pets or their food.
* **After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing:**  These actions expel germs into the air and onto your hands.  Washing your hands immediately after these actions can help stop the spread of infection.
* **Before inserting or removing contact lenses:**  Germs on your hands can easily contaminate your contact lenses, potentially causing eye infections.

##  The Right Way to Wash Your Hands 

You might think washing your hands is simple, but it's more than just a quick rinse.  It's about proper technique to ensure you're effectively removing germs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend the following seven steps:

1. **Wet your hands with clean, preferably running, water.**  Warm or cold water works equally well.
2. **Apply enough soap to cover all surfaces of your hands and wrists.**  Make sure to lather up thoroughly.
3. **Rub your hands together briskly and thoroughly.**  Don't forget to scrub the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your fingernails.  
4. **Scrub your hands and wrists for at least 20 seconds.**  It's helpful to hum the "Happy Birthday" song twice from beginning to end to ensure you've scrubbed for long enough.
5. **Rinse your hands and wrists under clean, preferably running, water.**
6. **Dry your hands and wrists with a clean towel, or let them air-dry.**
7. **Use a towel to turn off the faucet.**

##  Handwashing  in a World of Hand Sanitizer 

We live in a world where hand sanitizer is readily available. While it's a great tool when soap and water aren't accessible, it's not a replacement for proper handwashing. Here are some important considerations:

- **Alcohol content:**  Hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol to be effective.  Check the label!
- **Thorough application:**  Rub the sanitizer all over the surfaces of your hands and fingers, ensuring you cover all areas, including between your fingers and under your nails. 
- **Drying time:**  Allow the sanitizer to air-dry completely.  Don't wipe it off prematurely.

##  Caring for Your Hands 

Frequent handwashing can be harsh on your skin.  Here are some tips to prevent dryness and irritation:

- **Use a moisturizing soap:**  Look for soaps that contain glycerin or other moisturizing ingredients.  These will help keep your skin hydrated.
- **Apply hand cream or lotion regularly:**  This will replenish the moisture that's lost through frequent handwashing.
- **Avoid hot water:**  Hot water can dry out your skin.  Use warm or cool water instead.

##  What Should You Do If Soap and Water Aren't Available? 

When soap and water aren't readily available, alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be a valuable option.  They can quickly and effectively destroy many disease-causing agents, including:

- **The flu virus**
- **HIV**
- **Hepatitis B and C**
- **MRSA**
- **E. coli**

Remember, hand sanitizers are most effective when used properly.  Apply a generous amount to your hands, rub them together vigorously, and ensure the sanitizer dries completely before touching your face or any other surface.
