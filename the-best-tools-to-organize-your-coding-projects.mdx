Think of them as your time machine for code:

* **Git:**  The industry standard for version control, Git offers powerful features for managing code changes, branching, merging, and collaborating with others.  It's highly flexible and adaptable to various project types. 
* **SVN:**  Another popular version control system, SVN is known for its centralized architecture, where all changes are managed within a single repository. It's a robust option for managing larger projects with a well-defined workflow.
* **Mercurial:**   Similar to Git, Mercurial is a distributed version control system that offers excellent support for branching and merging.  It's a popular choice for projects that require flexible collaboration models.

The choice between these systems depends on your project size, team structure, and workflow preferences. While Git dominates the industry, SVN and Mercurial remain strong contenders for specific use cases.

### 4. Testing Tools:  Ensuring Quality and Reliability

It's tempting to skip testing, but it's a crucial step in building robust and reliable software.  Testing tools help you automate the process of identifying bugs, validating functionality, and ensuring your code meets the required standards.

* **Jest:** A widely used JavaScript testing framework, Jest offers a comprehensive suite of tools for creating, running, and reporting tests. It's known for its speed, ease of use, and built-in mocking capabilities.
