Let's be honest:  credit scores are a major factor in our financial lives.  A good credit score opens doors to better interest rates on loans, credit cards, and even mortgages. It can even impact things like your insurance premiums. But, what happens when your credit score isn’t where you want it to be? It can feel overwhelming trying to understand how to improve your score, and even more daunting to figure out how to do it quickly.

I've spent a lot of time researching this topic, and I've learned a thing or two along the way.  Based on my knowledge and the information I've gathered from my research, here are seven of the most effective ways to improve your credit score quickly:

## 1. Pay Your Bills on Time

This is arguably the single most impactful factor in boosting your credit score, and it accounts for a whopping 35% of your overall score.   Think of it like this:  creditors see your payment history as a direct reflection of how responsible you are with borrowed money.  Consistent on-time payments demonstrate that you’re a trustworthy borrower, and that translates to a higher credit score.

Here’s the good news:  even if you have a less-than-perfect credit history, making on-time payments from this point forward will immediately start to improve your score.   The longer you consistently make on-time payments, the more your score will benefit. 

**Actions you can take:**

* **Set up autopay:**  This is the easiest way to ensure you never miss a payment deadline.  Schedule automatic payments for at least the minimum amount due on all your credit cards, and consider setting up autopay for other bills as well.  
* **Create calendar reminders:**  If you prefer a more manual approach, create reminders on your calendar or phone for all your bill due dates.
* **Register for alerts:**  Many credit card companies and other service providers send you alerts when your bill is due.  Take advantage of this feature to stay on top of your payments.

## 2. Pay Down Revolving Account Balances

Your revolving credit utilization rate is a key factor in your credit score, accounting for 30%.  This refers to the percentage of your available credit that you're using on revolving accounts like credit cards.  The lower your utilization rate, the better.  Aim for a utilization rate of 30% or lower, and strive to keep it as low as possible.

**Actions you can take:**

* **Make more than the minimum payment:**  Instead of just paying the minimum amount due, focus on paying down your balances more aggressively. This will help lower your utilization rate quickly. 
* **Consider a debt consolidation loan:**  This can help you combine multiple credit card debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate.  Just be sure to shop around for the best rates and terms. 
* **Look into a balance transfer credit card:**  These cards offer a temporary 0% interest rate on your transferred balance.  Use this to your advantage to pay down your debt faster. 
* **Develop a debt management plan:**  There are various debt management strategies, such as the debt snowball or avalanche method. These help you prioritize which debts to pay down first, based on either the balance or the interest rate. 

## 3. Don’t Close Your Oldest Account

While it might seem intuitive to close old credit accounts you’re not using, this can actually hurt your credit score.  The length of your credit history accounts for 15% of your score, and the age of your oldest credit account is a significant factor.  

Think of it like this:  a longer credit history demonstrates that you’ve been managing credit responsibly over time.  Closing an old credit account, especially a long-standing one, can negatively impact your credit history and therefore your score.

**Actions you can take:**

* **Keep your oldest accounts open:**  Even if you don't actively use your oldest credit card, don't close it.  You can simply keep it open and use it for small, infrequent purchases.  
* **Consider a balance transfer:**  If you're not using a particular credit card, explore transferring the balance to a new card with more favorable terms.  This allows you to maintain your credit history while getting better rates. 

## 4. Diversify the Types of Credit You Have

Credit mix accounts for 10% of your score, and it reflects the variety of credit accounts you have. A diverse mix of credit, such as a mix of credit cards, mortgages, and installment loans, shows that you’re capable of managing different types of credit responsibly.  This demonstrates to creditors that you’re a well-rounded borrower, which can lead to a higher credit score.

**Actions you can take:**

* **Apply for a credit-builder loan:** If you're new to credit or are looking to diversify your credit mix, a credit-builder loan is a great option. These loans are designed to help you build credit by reporting your on-time payments to the credit bureaus.  
* **Consider a secured credit card:**  These cards require you to make a security deposit that serves as your credit limit, making them less risky for issuers.  Secured credit cards are a good way to build credit if you have a limited credit history.

## 5. Limit New Credit Applications

Every time you apply for a new credit account, the lender will perform a hard inquiry on your credit report. This can negatively impact your credit score, especially if you apply for multiple credit accounts within a short period of time. These inquiries are recorded on your credit report and stay there for two years, although they only affect your score for a year.

**Actions you can take:**

* **Apply for credit only when you need it:**  Avoid applying for credit cards or loans just for the sake of building credit.   Only apply when you have a genuine need for the credit. 
* **Consider prequalification:**  Before applying for a loan or credit card, see if the lender offers prequalification.  This allows you to check your eligibility without impacting your credit score.
* **Space out your applications:**  If you need to apply for multiple credit accounts, spread out your applications over a longer period of time.  This helps to minimize the negative impact on your score.

## 6. Dispute Inaccurate Information on Your Credit Report

Incorrect or inaccurate information on your credit report can significantly lower your credit score, especially if it's a serious issue such as a late payment or a high credit card balance. If you're a victim of identity theft, you may find multiple derogatory marks on your credit report.

**Actions you can take:**

* **Obtain a free copy of your credit report:**  Review your credit report from all three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) to identify any inaccuracies or errors.  
* **Dispute any errors:**  If you find any incorrect information, contact the credit reporting agency and file a dispute.  This will trigger an investigation, and the agency will correct any errors if they're found to be valid. 

## 7. Become an Authorized User

Adding yourself as an authorized user to a credit card account, such as a parent's or close friend's, can have a positive impact on your credit score, especially if you’re new to credit or are rebuilding your credit after some setbacks.  It helps to demonstrate that you've been responsible with credit, even if you haven't yet established your own credit history.

**Actions you can take:**

* **Ask to be added as an authorized user:**  Find a close friend or family member with a good credit history and ask to be added as an authorized user on their credit card. 

## Frequently Asked Questions:
