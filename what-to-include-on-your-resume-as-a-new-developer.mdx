You've just graduated, maybe completed a bootcamp, or perhaps you've been teaching yourself the ins and outs of coding. Youâ€™re ready to take on the world of software development, and that means crafting a killer resume. But where do you begin? As a new developer, the world of resumes can feel daunting, with a seemingly endless list of things to include and considerations to make. 

Let me tell you, I've been there. When I first started out, building my resume felt like trying to decipher a cryptic code. I wasn't sure what skills were essential, how to highlight my achievements, or even what format to use. It took a lot of trial and error, but eventually, I learned the secrets to crafting a resume that got me noticed by hiring managers. 

Today, I want to share my experience and the insights I've gathered from researching best practices and interviewing dozens of recruiters and hiring managers. Let's break down the essential elements of a winning resume for a new developer, focusing on what to include and what to leave out. 

## The Foundation: What to Include on Your Resume

Think of your resume as a carefully curated showcase of your abilities. It should clearly demonstrate your skills, experience, and potential while showcasing your dedication to continuous learning and career growth. Here's a breakdown of the essential sections you'll need:

### 1.  Contact Information

This seems obvious, but it's essential to get it right.  Include your full name, a professional email address (one that is clear and easy to read - think firstname.lastname@email.com), phone number, and your current city. You don't need to list your address.

### 2. Work Experience

This section is where you'll showcase your real-world experience, whether from internships, personal projects, or even part-time gigs. Remember, it's not always about the quantity of experience, but rather the quality and the impact you've made. 

* **Focus on Results:** Don't just list your responsibilities; quantify your accomplishments with metrics and numbers. For example, instead of saying, "I worked on a project to improve website performance," try "Improved website performance by 25% by optimizing database queries."
* **Highlight Key Skills:**  Emphasize relevant technical skills and frameworks you've used. Don't be afraid to list multiple languages or frameworks you've mastered, but focus on showcasing your proficiency in a few key areas.
* **Prioritize Projects:**  If you don't have a lot of traditional work experience, focus on showcasing your personal projects.  This is your chance to demonstrate your initiative, creativity, and ability to tackle challenging problems. Be sure to describe the project, the technologies you used, and the impact you achieved. 

### 3. Education

This section is particularly important for new developers.  It allows you to showcase your foundational knowledge and skills. 

* **Include Relevant Classes:**  List any relevant programming or math courses you took in school.  Highlight any specific projects or coursework that demonstrate your skills. 
* **GPA:**  Include your GPA if it's above 3.2, especially if you just finished a software engineering bootcamp.  

### 4. Skills

This section is your chance to showcase your technical prowess. It's where you'll list the languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies you're proficient in. 

* **Prioritize In-Demand Technologies:** Highlight your experience with modern frameworks like React, Node.js, or Python.  Show off your knowledge of cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, and any other technologies that are shaping the future of software development. 
* **Balance Technical and Soft Skills:**  Don't just list technical skills; also include soft skills that are crucial for success in the software development world.  This includes skills like problem-solving, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and adaptability.
* **Quantify Your Expertise:**  When possible, provide concrete examples or metrics that demonstrate your proficiency.  For example, instead of simply listing "JavaScript," you could say, "Proficient in JavaScript, including experience with React and Node.js."

### 5. Summary (Optional)

While not always required, a summary is a great way to introduce yourself and highlight your most impactful achievements and skills. 

* **Focus on Your Value:**  Keep it concise, aiming for three to five sentences.  Highlight your most relevant experience and skills, showcasing how they align with the specific job you're applying for.  For example, you could say, "A recent graduate with a passion for full-stack development and a strong foundation in React and Node.js.  Demonstrated ability to develop scalable applications, optimize performance, and work collaboratively in a team setting."
* **Include Keywords:**  Use keywords from the job description to increase your chances of being noticed by an applicant tracking system (ATS), a software program that scans resumes to identify relevant candidates.

##  What to Leave Off Your Resume

While it's crucial to showcase your skills and experience, there are also things you should avoid including on your resume as a new developer. Here's what to leave out:

### 1. Outdated or Irrelevant Information

Don't include jobs that are more than ten years old or that are unrelated to your current career goals.  This includes any projects or skills that you haven't used recently or that are not relevant to the types of roles you're targeting.  Focus on showcasing your most relevant and valuable experience. 

### 2. Personal Photo

Adding a photo to your resume is generally not recommended in the US, as it can potentially lead to discrimination.  Focus on highlighting your skills and experience instead.

### 3. Writing in the Third Person

Using the third person ("He/She is...") can come across as overly formal and even unprofessional.  Stick to writing your resume in the first person ("I am..." or "I have..."). 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How do I stand out in a crowded field?

It's a competitive market, but you can stand out by crafting a compelling resume that showcases your skills, experience, and potential. Focus on quantifying your impact with numbers and metrics.  Highlight any unique projects or experiences that showcase your passion for software development, your creativity, and your ability to solve complex problems.

### 2. What if I don't have a lot of work experience? 

Don't worry! This is common for new developers. Focus on highlighting your personal projects. Showcase your skills and achievements by describing your projects in detail, the technologies you used, and the impact you achieved. 

### 3. How can I make sure my resume is ATS-friendly?

Many companies use applicant tracking systems (ATS), software programs that scan resumes for relevant keywords.  To make your resume ATS-friendly, use industry standard terminology for technical skills and frameworks. Make sure your keywords are consistent throughout your resume. 

### 4.  What if I have a career gap? 

Don't let a career gap hold you back. Explain the gap in a concise and positive way.  Focus on any relevant skills or certifications you gained during that time, and highlight any personal projects you completed. 

### 5. How do I write a compelling resume summary?

A good resume summary will highlight your most relevant skills and experience, and it should showcase your value to the company.  Keep it concise, aiming for three to five sentences.  Use strong action verbs and quantify your accomplishments with numbers and metrics.
